# Check Implementation

Review implementation against PRP requirements and validate all deliverables.

## PRP File: $ARGUMENTS

## Review Process

1. **Load Context**
   - Read the specified PRP file
   - Understand all requirements and acceptance criteria
   - Note validation commands and success metrics

2. **Analyze Implementation**
   - Run git diff to see all changes made
   - Map each PRP requirement to actual implementation
   - Verify all tasks from PRP are completed

3. **Run Validations**
   - Execute each validation command from PRP
   - Document results (pass/fail)
   - If failures, analyze root cause

4. **Quality Check**
   - Verify code follows patterns specified in PRP
   - Check error handling matches requirements
   - Confirm edge cases are handled
   - Review test coverage for critical logic

5. **Gap Analysis**
   - List any missing PRP requirements
   - Document failed validations
   - Identify quality issues

6. **Report Results**
   - Summarize implementation status
   - Provide confidence score
   - List any required fixes

Note: Always re-read the PRP to ensure nothing was missed during implementation.
