# VO2 Max Development Protocol

## Core Mechanism

VO2 max adaptations require **3-8 minute intervals at 90-100% max HR** to stress cardiac output long enough for ventricular remodeling (stroke volume increase). Shorter intervals (< 2 min) train anaerobic capacity instead. Longer efforts (> 8 min) drop below threshold intensity. Accumulate **12-20 min total work time** for mitochondrial stimulus - intervals let you spend more time at target intensity than continuous work.

**Adaptation timeline:**
- 60% of gains in first 4 weeks (rapid cardiac response)
- 85% by week 8 (mitochondrial density catching up)
- 95% by week 12 (plateau - diminishing returns after this)
- Maintenance: 1x/week preserves 90% of gains for 4-6 weeks

**Minimum effective dose:** 1x/week, 3×4 min @ 95% max HR (12 min total) - enough for maintenance, not development

## Prescription

**When to apply:**
- Endurance goals (running, cycling, rowing)
- Aerobic base exists (> 8 weeks Zone 2)
- Not in taper or concurrent strength block

**Standard workout:** 4-5 × 4-5 min @ 95-100% max HR (RPE 9-10), rest 3-4 min easy
- **Total work**: 12-20 min at target intensity
- **Frequency**: 1-2x/week max (more doesn't accelerate adaptation)
- **Variants**: 6×3 min (steep hill), 8×2 min (tolerance), fartlek surges (sport-specific)

**Context modifiers:**
- **Week 1-2**: Start 3×3-4 min (build tolerance, neural adaptation)
- **Concurrent strength** (if unavoidable): 1x/week max, upper body emphasis
- **Recovery-limited** (< 5 sessions/week): 1x/week only, prioritize Zone 2 volume
- **Sport-specific** (rugby, soccer): Fartlek format mimics game surges better than track intervals

**Recovery cost:** High - equivalent to ~3-4x Zone 2 session in terms of systemic fatigue
- CNS stress: Moderate-high (near-maximal output)
- Cardiac stress: Maximal (primary stimulus)
- Muscular damage: Low (no eccentric load)
- Systemic fatigue: High (full-body oxygen debt)

**Integration constraints:**
- **Requires**: 2-3x/week Zone 2 base (ratio 2:1 minimum, Zone 2:VO2max volume)
- **Spacing**: 48-72 hrs from other high-intensity or heavy lower body strength
- **Same day**: If unavoidable, strength first (cardiac fatigue kills lifting performance)
- **Interference**: Reduces strength gains ~15-20% if within 6 hrs of lifting
- **Compatible**: Threshold work (1x/week), upper body strength (any timing)

## Boundaries & Trade-offs

**Skip VO2 max work if:**
- No aerobic base (< 8 weeks Zone 2) - build foundation first
- Concurrent strength focus - interference effect reduces strength gains ~15-20%
- Already fatigued/overtrained - high systemic stress
- Taper phase - use race-pace work instead (less fatigue, maintains sharpness)
- Limited recovery capacity (< 4 sessions/week) - Zone 2 + threshold more valuable

**Trade-off surface:**
- Each VO2 max session costs 3-4x Zone 2 session in recovery budget
- Adding VO2 max to strength program: -15% strength gains, +20% aerobic capacity
- 2x/week VO2 max vs 1x/week: +10% gains, +50% injury/overtraining risk
- VO2 max vs threshold focus: +5% peak aerobic power, -10% lactate clearance endurance

**Priority hierarchy:**
1. **Aerobic base** (Zone 2) - ALWAYS maintain, prerequisite for VO2 max work
2. **VO2 max** - Second priority for endurance athletes (after base exists)
3. **Threshold** - Complementary, not competitive (do both)
4. **Strength** - Separate blocks or accept 15% strength interference

## Common Errors

**"More intervals = more VO2 max"** - Cardiac remodeling saturates around 16-20 min total work. Extra volume adds fatigue without triggering faster adaptation. Cap at 20 min; add Zone 2 or threshold volume instead.

**"10K pace is VO2 max intensity"** - 10K pace (~30-40 min sustainable) is below VO2 max threshold. True VO2 max requires near-maximal cardiac output (3-5K pace, 95-100% max HR, RPE 9-10).

**"Year-round VO2 max training"** - Adaptations plateau at 8-12 weeks; continued high intensity accumulates fatigue without gains. Block periodize: 8-12 week build, then maintain 1x/week while focusing elsewhere.

**"VO2 max intervals on fatigued legs"** - Muscular fatigue limits running velocity needed to stress cardiovascular system maximally. Submaximal leg output = submaximal cardiac stress. Schedule 48+ hrs after heavy lower body work.

## Application Logic

```
Aerobic base > 8 weeks? NO → Build Zone 2 base first
                        YES ↓
Endurance goal? NO → Skip (or 1x/week maintenance)
                YES ↓
Strength block? YES → Skip (interference effect)
                NO ↓
Recovery capacity? LOW (< 4x/week) → Zone 2 + threshold better
                   HIGH → APPLY VO2 max 1-2x/week
```

## Protocol Application Checklist

When programming VO2 max work, verify:

- [ ] Aerobic base established (minimum 8 weeks Zone 2 training)
- [ ] Interval structure specified (3-8min work intervals @ 90-100% max HR)
- [ ] Total work time appropriate (12-20min high-intensity volume)
- [ ] Frequency limited to 1-2x/week maximum
- [ ] Recovery between intervals adequate (3-4min active recovery)
- [ ] Zone 2 training maintained (2:1 ratio, Zone 2:VO2max volume)
- [ ] (if concurrent training) Separated from heavy lower body strength by 48-72hr
- [ ] (if same-day unavoidable) Strength scheduled first
- [ ] Common errors avoided (see section above)
