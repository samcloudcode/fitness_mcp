# LeoMoves-Style HIIT

## Core Mechanism
LeoMoves training combines bodyweight calisthenics, animal flows, locomotion patterns, and capoeira-inspired movements into complex sequences executed under HIIT intervals. Creates simultaneous adaptations across three systems: motor learning (coordination via cortical/cerebellar restructuring), neuromuscular power (Type II fiber recruitment + motor unit synchronization), and cardiac capacity (VO2max). The unique dual-tax on CNS—pattern execution + explosive effort—distinguishes this from traditional HIIT. Work intervals of 20-30s hit power-coordination window without pure aerobic drift.

**Adaptation timeline:**
- Motor patterns: Fast initial learning (days-2 weeks), refinement (4-6 weeks), mastery (8-12+ weeks)
- RFD/Power: 10-15% gains by week 4-8
- VO2max: 5-10% gains by week 8-12
- Plateau point: Movement complexity at 4-6 weeks without progression, power at 8-10 weeks
- Maintenance dose: 2x/week preserves adaptations

**Minimum effective dose:** 2x/week for maintenance, 3-4x/week for progression

## Prescription
**When to apply:**
- Building movement quality + conditioning simultaneously
- Power-endurance without heavy external loads
- Bridging strength and sport-specific movement
- Maintaining cardiac fitness during strength phases
- Movement variability and body awareness development

**Standard format:** 4-8 rounds × (20-30s LeoMoves pattern, 10s rest)
- **Key parameters**:
  - Work: 20-30s @ 85-95% effort (not max sprint)
  - Rest: 10s (enough to reset, not full recovery)
  - Rounds: 4-8 (beginners), 8-12 (advanced)
  - Movements: Animal flows (bear crawls, crab walks, ape movements), locomotion patterns, plyometric transitions, handstand progressions, calisthenics flow combos
- **Total session duration**:
  - Beginner (6 rounds): 3.5min intervals + 5min warmup + 5min cooldown = ~13-15min
  - Intermediate (8 rounds): 4.7min intervals + 5-8min warmup + 5min cooldown = ~15-20min
  - Advanced (12 rounds): 7min intervals + 8min warmup + 10min cooldown = ~25min
- **Variants**:
  - Tabata style: 20s on, 10s off × 8 rounds
  - Extended: 30s on, 10s off × 6-10 rounds
  - Density: 25s on, 15s off (more recovery for complex patterns)
  - LeoMoves Tabata Challenge: 15 min advanced protocol (8 movements × multiple rounds)

**Context modifiers:**
- **High baseline strength**: Increase complexity/explosiveness, decrease rounds
- **Low movement competency**: Simplify patterns (basic animal flows), increase rest to 15-20s
- **In-season athletes**: Reduce to 2x/week, focus on coordination maintenance
- **Concurrent strength training**: Separate by 4-6h or use opposite days
- **Heavy CNS fatigue**: Skip or reduce to 2-4 rounds as active recovery
- **Deload weeks**: Cut rounds by 50%, maintain complexity at lower effort (70-80%)

**Recovery cost:** HIGH
- CNS: **High** (dual tax: pattern execution + explosive effort)
- Cardiac: **Moderate-High** (interval intensity 85-95% VO2max)
- Muscular: **Low-Moderate** (bodyweight, limited eccentric damage)
- Systemic: **Moderate-High** (cumulative stress from coordination + cardio)

**Integration constraints:**
- **Requires**: Movement competency baseline (can execute basic flows with good form fresh), cardiac base (can sustain intervals without form breakdown), mobility for ground-based patterns
- **Spacing**: 48h minimum between sessions, 48h from maximal strength work (squats/deads >85% 1RM)
- **Interference**: 2025 research shows HIIT (>95% VO2max) + heavy resistance (>10RM) = maximal interference. At 85-95% intensity, expect:
  - -10-15% strength adaptation if <24h from heavy lifting
  - -5-10% hypertrophy if high weekly volume (>3x/week)
  - Minimal interference if separated by 4-6h or opposite days
- **Compatible**: Skill work (before LeoMoves), hypertrophy training (separate days), moderate steady cardio (after LeoMoves), mobility sessions

## Boundaries & Trade-offs
**Skip if:**
- Maximal strength phase (>85% 1RM dominates program)
- Acute CNS fatigue (poor sleep, accumulated stress, performance decay)
- Movement pattern injury risk (poor form under fatigue = ingrained dysfunction)
- Pure hypertrophy goal (interference without movement benefit)
- <24h from heavy squat/deadlift session
- Wrist/shoulder injury (ground-based patterns load these heavily)

**Trade-off surface:**
- +30-40% novel pattern competency (4-6 weeks) vs -10-15% maximal strength (if concurrent heavy lifting)
- +10-15% RFD/power (4-8 weeks) vs +5-10% cardiac load (recovery demand)
- +Movement variability/body awareness vs -Specificity (not sport-specific skill refinement)
- 3x/week: +15% faster coordination gains vs +30% injury risk (fatigue-induced form breakdown)

**Priority hierarchy:**
1. After maximal strength work (if same day, separate by 4-6h minimum)
2. Before steady cardio (preserve power quality)
3. Separate day from heavy squats/deadlifts (CNS competition)
4. After skill/technical work (fatigue degrades motor learning)
5. Never before maximal testing or competition (<48h)

## Common Errors
**"Adding complexity under fatigue"** - Motor learning degrades when CNS is taxed. Adding new LeoMoves patterns in rounds 8-12 ingrains compensatory movement. Solution: Introduce complexity fresh (rounds 1-4), simplify to familiar flows as fatigue accumulates.

**"Daily practice for faster gains"** - 2025 neuroscience: neural restructuring requires 48h+ recovery. Daily sessions = accumulated CNS fatigue without consolidation, performance decay by week 2-3. Stick to 2-4x/week max.

**"Mixing with maximal strength same session"** - 2025 research confirms HIIT + heavy resistance (>10RM) = maximal interference at molecular level (divergent signaling pathways). Heavy squats → 4h gap → LeoMoves HIIT, or separate days entirely.

**"Chasing work rate over movement quality"** - Speed/explosiveness at cost of pattern integrity wastes coordination adaptation. If animal flow form breaks down by round 5, stop or simplify. Quality reps >> high-volume slop.

**"No progression after 4-6 weeks"** - Motor learning plateaus without novelty. Static complexity = neural efficiency caps at 6 weeks, no further adaptation. Progression: new movement sequences, increased explosiveness, added constraints (single-leg variations, rotational elements, handstand progressions).

**"Ignoring rest intervals"** - 10s rest critical for power quality. Shortening to 5s or removing rest shifts to pure conditioning, loses RFD stimulus. Lengthening to 20-30s allows full recovery, loses interval benefit. Stick to 10-15s.

**"Skipping mobility prerequisites"** - LeoMoves patterns (deep squats, ground transitions, handstands) require ankle/hip/thoracic mobility. Forcing patterns without ROM = compensatory dysfunction. Screen mobility first, address limitations before complex flows.

## Application Logic
```
Assess context:
├─ Maximal strength phase (>85% 1RM focus)? → SKIP or limit to 1x/week maintenance
├─ Heavy CNS fatigue (poor sleep, performance decay)? → SKIP or active recovery (2-4 rounds @ 70%)
├─ <24h from heavy squats/deads? → SKIP or separate by 4-6h
├─ Movement competency low? → Simplify patterns (basic animal flows), extend rest to 15-20s
├─ Wrist/shoulder limitation? → Modify ground patterns or skip
└─ Otherwise → PROCEED

Select format:
├─ New to LeoMoves? → 20s on, 15s off × 4-6 rounds, simple patterns (bear crawl, crab walk)
├─ Building coordination + power? → 25s on, 10s off × 6-8 rounds, moderate complexity (flow combos)
├─ Advanced movement + conditioning? → 30s on, 10s off × 8-12 rounds, high complexity (handstand transitions)
└─ In-season maintenance? → 20s on, 10s off × 4-6 rounds, familiar patterns only

Integration:
├─ Same day as strength? → Strength first, 4-6h gap, then LeoMoves HIIT
├─ Separate days? → Ideal (48h between heavy strength and LeoMoves)
├─ With steady cardio? → LeoMoves first (preserve power), cardio after
└─ With skill work? → Skill first (fresh CNS), LeoMoves after

Progress when (4-6 weeks):
├─ Patterns feel automatic (low cognitive load)? → Add complexity or explosiveness
├─ Recovery <48h between sessions? → Maintain frequency, increase difficulty
└─ Form breaks down late in session? → Maintain complexity, improve conditioning base first
```
