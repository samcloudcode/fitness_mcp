# Spine Health & Injury Prevention

## Purpose

Protecting the spine through core stability, proper loading mechanics, and mobility preservation. The spine is vulnerable to injury when muscles fatigue (losing ability to stabilize), excessive loading occurs in flexed or hyperextended positions, or repetitive microtrauma accumulates from poor movement patterns. Building **core endurance** (ability to maintain braced neutral spine under load for extended periods) prevents the majority of lower back injuries. Teaching the body to hinge at hips rather than flex at spine during loaded movements (deadlifts, picking up objects, rowing) distributes forces to strong glute/hamstring muscles instead of vulnerable lumbar discs. Maintaining spinal mobility through daily unloaded flexion/extension prevents stiffness that can shift stress to single segments (disc or facet joint overload).

## Application

**When to apply:**
- Injury prevention for anyone doing loaded training (squats, deadlifts, overhead work)
- History of lower back pain or disc issues
- Occupations with prolonged sitting or repetitive bending/lifting

**How to apply:**

**McGill Big 3 (daily core stability protocol):**
1. **Modified Curl-Up:** Hands under lower back, lift head/shoulders (no spinal flexion), 3×10s holds per side
2. **Side Plank:** Elbow under shoulder, straight line from head to knees/feet, 3×10s holds per side
3. **Bird-Dog:** Opposite arm/leg extended, core braced, hips level, 3×10s holds per side

**Dosage:** Daily, 5-7 min total. Short high-tension holds (10s) build capacity without fatigue. Progress to 15-20s holds, NOT added load.

**Hip Hinge Mechanics:**
- **Cue:** "Short-stop squat" - hips back, spine neutral, hamstring stretch (NOT lower back pull)
- **Bracing:** Breath into belly → 360° core tension → hinge at hips → maintain brace → exhale at top
- **Application:** Practice unloaded daily (10 reps), apply to deadlifts, rows, swings, picking up objects

**Spinal Mobility (daily unloaded):**
- Cat-Camel: 10 slow cycles flexion/extension, lubricates segments
- Child's Pose: 30-60s hold, passive flexion
- Cobra/Sphinx: 30-60s hold, reverses sitting posture
- Dead Hang: 20-30s, spinal decompression via traction
- Thoracic Rotation: 10 reps each direction, maintains rotational mobility

**Dosage:** 5-10 min daily (can split). UNLOADED only.

## Contraindications

**Do NOT apply if:**
- Acute disc herniation with radiating leg pain/numbness (medical evaluation needed)
- Recent spinal surgery, cauda equina symptoms (bowel/bladder loss, saddle numbness - emergency)
- Spinal fracture or severe osteoporosis

**Warning signs:**
- Sharp shooting pain → stop immediately, assess pattern
- Radiating leg pain → avoid loaded flexion, seek assessment
- Increased pain 24hrs post-training → reduce load/volume

## Integration with Training

**Sequencing:**
- Pre-lifting (5-10min): Cat-camel, hip hinge practice, McGill Big 3
- During lifting: Apply bracing/hinge to all loaded movements
- Post-workout (5-10min): Mobility work (child's pose, cobra, dead hang)
- Daily separate: Full protocol + mobility (ideal if time permits)

**Compatible with:** All strength/endurance training (enhances safety, improves posture), yoga/mobility

**Reduce if:** Acute back pain flare-up (gentle mobility only), excessive soreness (deload), travel (minimum: cat-camel, child's pose, bodyweight hinge)

## Common Errors

**"Lifting with rounded spine under load"** - Spinal flexion combined with compressive force (heavy deadlift, picking up weight with rounded back) massively increases disc pressure and shear stress on posterior annulus. Single instance may not injure, but repetition accumulates microtrauma leading to disc herniation. Correct: ALWAYS hip hinge with neutral spine (imagine broomstick touching back of head, mid-back, tailbone throughout movement), load glutes and hamstrings, NOT spine.

**"Hyperextending spine during squats or overhead press"** - Excessive lumbar arch ("ribs flared") shifts load to facet joints and creates shear forces. Often compensation for poor hip mobility or weak core stabilizers. Increases risk of spondylolisthesis (vertebral slippage) and facet joint arthritis over time. Correct: "Ribs down" cue, engage anterior core to prevent excessive arch, improve hip flexor/lat mobility to achieve positions without compensatory lumbar extension.

**"Using lower back motion instead of hips during repetitive movements"** - Examples: bent-over rows with spinal flexion/extension vs hip hinge, back extensions with excessive spinal range vs controlled hip hinge. Spine designed for STABILITY during movement, hips designed for MOBILITY. Forcing spine to move repetitively under load fatigues stabilizers and wears discs. Correct: Move through hips (flexion/extension), keep spine braced neutral, feel work in glutes/hamstrings NOT lower back muscles.

**"Doing endurance core work to failure"** - Long planks (2-3 min), high-rep sit-ups, core circuits to exhaustion. Research shows this fatigues stabilizers which then cannot protect spine during subsequent activities. Core endurance is necessary, but should NOT be trained to failure right before lifting or daily activities. Correct: McGill Big 3 protocol - short, high-tension holds that build capacity without fatigue, perform separate from or before (not after) heavy lifting.

**"Ignoring pain signals and 'pushing through' back discomfort"** - Lower back pain during/after training is a warning signal of improper loading or excessive volume. Unlike muscle soreness (diffuse, achy), joint/disc pain (sharp, localized) indicates tissue stress. Continuing to train through it risks converting minor irritation into serious injury (disc herniation, stress fracture). Correct: Stop exercise causing pain, assess form, reduce load/range, consult professional if persistent. Differentiate "good" fatigue from "bad" pain.

## Application Checklist

- [ ] No acute back pain or radiating symptoms (leg numbness, sharp pain down leg)
- [ ] Can perform hip hinge pattern without rounding spine (bodyweight test: hand slide down thighs, feel hamstring stretch NOT back pull)
- [ ] Can brace core effectively (360° tension, "ribs down" position, breath into belly not chest)
- [ ] Cleared by physician if post-injury or chronic back issues
- [ ] Performing McGill Big 3 daily or 5+ days/week (consistency builds resilience)
- [ ] All loaded movements use hip hinge mechanics, NOT spinal flexion/extension
- [ ] Daily spinal mobility work (cat-camel, child's pose, cobra, dead hang) maintains ROM
- [ ] Pain signals monitored and respected (stop if sharp pain, modify if dull ache persists)
