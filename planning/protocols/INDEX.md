# Protocol Index

This directory contains specialized protocols for prevention, performance enhancement, and recovery optimization. Use this index to determine which protocol files to load for specific situations.

## When to Load Each Protocol

### [knee-health-prevention.md](knee-health-prevention.md)
**Load when:**
- User has knee injury history or current knee issues
- Programming squats, lunges, running, or jumping activities
- User reports knee instability or valgus collapse (knees caving in)
- User asks about knee strengthening or injury prevention

**What you'll find:** Daily 10-15min circuit protocol, exercise selection for knee health, progression guidelines, contraindications

---

### [tendon-health.md](tendon-health.md)
**Load when:**
- User has tendinopathy (tennis elbow, patellar tendinopathy, Achilles issues)
- User reports tendon pain or is recovering from tendon injury
- Programming for high-load sports (overhead athletes, runners)
- User asks about tendon strengthening or collagen synthesis

**What you'll find:** Isometric loading protocol (4×30s @ 70% MVC), frequency/timing guidelines (2-3×/day, 6-8hr spacing), collagen supplementation protocol, anti-RICE approach

---

### [vo2max-development.md](vo2max-development.md)
**Load when:**
- User has endurance performance goals (running, cycling, rowing)
- Programming aerobic/cardio training with intensity variation
- User asks about improving VO2 max or aerobic capacity
- Determining if VO2 max work fits with concurrent strength training

**What you'll find:** Interval structure and dosage (3-8min @ 90-100% max HR), frequency guidelines (1-2×/week max), adaptation timeline, interference effects with strength training, trade-offs and prerequisites

---

### [sauna-cold-exposure.md](sauna-cold-exposure.md)
**Load when:**
- User asks about ice baths, cold plunges, or sauna use
- Determining optimal timing for recovery modalities relative to training
- User wants to enhance endurance performance through sauna
- Assessing if cold exposure will interfere with hypertrophy goals

**What you'll find:** Cold water immersion interference windows (avoid 0-4hrs post-strength), sauna protocols for endurance enhancement (+5% VO2 peak), application logic by training type, contrast therapy protocols
