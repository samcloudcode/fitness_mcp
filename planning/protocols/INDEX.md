# Protocol Index

This directory contains specialized protocols for prevention, performance enhancement, and recovery optimization. Use this index to determine which protocol files to load for specific situations.

## When to Load Each Protocol

### [knee-health-prevention.md](knee-health-prevention.md)
**Load when:**
- User has knee injury history or current knee issues
- Programming squats, lunges, running, or jumping activities
- User reports knee instability or valgus collapse (knees caving in)
- User asks about knee strengthening or injury prevention

**What you'll find:** Daily 10-15min circuit protocol, exercise selection for knee health, progression guidelines, contraindications

---

### [tendon-health.md](tendon-health.md)
**Load when:**
- User has tendinopathy (tennis elbow, patellar tendinopathy, Achilles issues)
- User reports tendon pain or is recovering from tendon injury
- Programming for high-load sports (overhead athletes, runners)
- User asks about tendon strengthening or collagen synthesis

**What you'll find:** Isometric loading protocol (4×30s @ 70% MVC), frequency/timing guidelines (2-3×/day, 6-8hr spacing), collagen supplementation protocol, anti-RICE approach

---

### [vo2max-development.md](vo2max-development.md)
**Load when:**
- User has endurance performance goals (running, cycling, rowing)
- Programming aerobic/cardio training with intensity variation
- User asks about improving VO2 max or aerobic capacity
- Determining if VO2 max work fits with concurrent strength training

**What you'll find:** Interval structure and dosage (3-8min @ 90-100% max HR), frequency guidelines (1-2×/week max), adaptation timeline, interference effects with strength training, trade-offs and prerequisites

---

### [leomoves-hiit.md](leomoves-hiit.md)
**Load when:**
- User mentions LeoMoves training or complex movement patterns
- Programming HIIT with bodyweight/calisthenics/animal flows
- User wants movement quality + conditioning combined
- Building power-endurance without heavy external loads
- Determining interference with concurrent strength training

**What you'll find:** LeoMoves methodology (20-30s on, 10s rest format), adaptation timeline for motor learning + power + cardio, CNS recovery requirements (48h), integration constraints with strength work (-10-15% interference if <24h), progression guidelines for movement complexity

---

### [greasing-the-groove.md](greasing-the-groove.md)
**Load when:**
- User wants to develop bodyweight skills (pull-ups, push-ups, pistol squats)
- Programming distributed practice throughout the day
- User has sedentary occupation and needs movement strategies
- Determining fitness maintenance during busy periods
- User asks about exercise snacking or NEAT (Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis)

**What you'll find:** Greasing the Groove protocol (5-10 sets/day at 40-60% max, 3+ hours apart), exercise snacking formats (<5min vigorous 2x/day), NEAT strategies, adaptation timelines, integration with main training, interference windows

---

### [sauna-cold-exposure.md](sauna-cold-exposure.md)
**Load when:**
- User asks about ice baths, cold plunges, or sauna use
- Determining optimal timing for recovery modalities relative to training
- User wants to enhance endurance performance through sauna
- Assessing if cold exposure will interfere with hypertrophy goals

**What you'll find:** Cold water immersion interference windows (avoid 0-4hrs post-strength), sauna protocols for endurance enhancement (+5% VO2 peak), application logic by training type, contrast therapy protocols

---

### [concurrent-training.md](concurrent-training.md)
**Load when:**
- Programming hybrid training (strength + endurance together)
- User asks about combining lifting and cardio
- Determining session sequencing on same day
- Assessing interference effects between modalities
- Planning block emphasis rotation (strength-focus vs endurance-focus)

**What you'll find:** AMPK/mTOR interference mechanisms, 6-8hr separation rules, same-day session ordering (skill→strength→cardio), low-impact cardio selection, block periodization frameworks, energy balance requirements, auto-regulation strategies

---

### [spine-health.md](spine-health.md)
**Load when:**
- User has lower back pain history or current back issues
- Programming squats, deadlifts, or loaded hip hinge movements
- User asks about core stability or back injury prevention
- Reviewing movement mechanics before heavy lifting

**What you'll find:** McGill Big 3 protocol (curl-up, side plank, bird-dog with dosage), hip hinge mechanics and bracing techniques, spinal mobility routines (cat-camel, cobra, dead hangs), contraindications for acute disc issues, integration with strength training

---

### [recovery-deload.md](recovery-deload.md)
**Load when:**
- Determining when to schedule deload week
- User showing signs of accumulated fatigue (elevated resting HR, poor sleep, performance plateau)
- Planning program periodization (deload frequency)
- User asks about recovery strategies or feeling overtrained

**What you'll find:** Scheduled deload timing (every 4-8 weeks by training age), reactive deload triggers (resting HR, sleep, performance signals), deload methods (volume/intensity/frequency reduction), active recovery protocols, HRV/biometric monitoring guidelines
