# Recovery Management Protocol

## Purpose

Provides evidence-based frameworks for managing training stress and recovery to optimize adaptation while preventing overtraining. Covers rest day planning, deload strategies, fatigue monitoring, and recovery modalities.

## When to Use

- Planning program recovery strategy (program-creator)
- Determining weekly rest days (week-planner)
- Assessing if user needs unscheduled recovery (week-planner, workout-creator)
- Evaluating training logs for recovery adequacy
- Deciding between pushing forward vs backing off

## Decision Framework

### Core Recovery Principle

**Adaptation = Stress + Recovery**
- Training creates stress (breakdown)
- Recovery allows adaptation (supercompensation)
- Without adequate recovery, stress accumulates → fatigue → overtraining
- Goal: Maximize productive training stress while maintaining recoverability

### Recovery Timeline by Intensity and Volume

**Guideline: Recovery needed inversely related to intensity, directly related to volume**

| Training Type | Recovery Needed | Example |
|---------------|-----------------|---------|
| Very high intensity, low volume | 48-72 hours | Heavy singles/doubles (1RM testing) |
| High intensity, moderate volume | 36-48 hours | 5x5 @ 85% (strength work) |
| Moderate intensity, high volume | 24-48 hours | 4x10 @ 70% (hypertrophy) |
| Low intensity, high volume | 12-24 hours | Running, conditioning |
| Very low intensity | <12 hours, can train daily | Mobility, prehab, walking |

**Application**: Schedule high-stress sessions with adequate gap, or alternate muscle groups/movement patterns.

### Rest Day Planning

**Minimum Rest Days**: 1-2 complete rest days per week for most trainees
- More for beginners (lower work capacity) or high life stress
- Potentially less for advanced with excellent recovery habits
- Active recovery days count as partial rest

**Rest Day Distribution**:

*Option 1: Weekly rest (most common)*
```
Mon: Train
Tue: Train
Wed: OFF
Thu: Train
Fri: Train
Sat: Train
Sun: OFF
(2 rest days, distributed)
```

*Option 2: Consecutive rest (deload weeks)*
```
Mon: Train
Tue: Train
Wed: OFF
Thu: OFF
Fri: Train light
Sat: OFF
Sun: OFF
(More recovery when needed)
```

*Option 3: Active recovery*
```
Mon: Train (hard)
Tue: Train (hard)
Wed: Active recovery (light cardio, mobility)
Thu: Train (hard)
Fri: OFF (complete rest)
Sat: Train (moderate)
Sun: Active recovery
(Mix of complete rest + active recovery)
```

### Deload Programming

**See comprehensive deload guidance in deload-programming protocol** (if it exists)

**Quick Reference**:
- **When**: Every 3-6 weeks hard training (more frequent for advanced, less for beginners)
- **How**: Reduce volume 40-60% OR intensity 20-40% (volume deload most common)
- **Duration**: 1 week typically
- **Structure**: Maintain frequency (same training days), reduce per-session stress

### Fatigue Monitoring

**Objective Indicators** (from training logs):
1. **Performance decline**: Missing reps at expected loads 2+ sessions
2. **RPE creep**: Same loads feel harder (RPE 8 becomes RPE 9 at same weight)
3. **Volume tolerance drop**: Can't complete planned sets
4. **Injury niggles**: Minor joint pain, movement quality degradation

**Subjective Indicators** (user reports or log notes):
1. **Sleep quality**: Poor sleep, unrefreshing, insomnia
2. **Mood**: Irritability, lack of motivation for training
3. **Soreness**: Persistent muscle soreness beyond 48 hours
4. **Perceived effort**: Everything feels harder than it should
5. **Illness frequency**: Getting sick more often

**Fatigue Management Decision Tree**:
```
Fatigue indicators present?
├─ NO → Continue planned progression
└─ YES → How many indicators?
    ├─ 1-2 indicators, mild → Repeat last workout (don't progress)
    ├─ 3-4 indicators, moderate → Reduce volume 20-30% this session
    └─ 5+ indicators, severe → Deload week or multiple off days
```

### Training Frequency by Muscle Group/Movement

**Frequency Guidelines** (sessions per muscle group per week):

| Training Age | Strength Focus | Hypertrophy Focus |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Beginner | 2-3x | 2x |
| Intermediate | 2-4x | 2-3x |
| Advanced | 2-4x | 3-4x |

**Key Principle**: Higher frequency requires lower per-session volume (spread volume across sessions)

**Example Frequency Application**:
```
Strength Program (Upper/Lower 4x/week):
- Squat frequency: 2x/week (Mon lower, Thu lower)
- Bench frequency: 2x/week (Tue upper, Sat upper)
- Recovery: 2-3 days between same muscle groups

Hypertrophy Program (PPL 6x/week):
- Push frequency: 2x/week (Mon, Thu)
- Pull frequency: 2x/week (Tue, Fri)
- Legs frequency: 2x/week (Wed, Sat)
- Recovery: 3 days between same muscle groups
```

### Recovery Modalities (Evidence-Based)

**High-Impact Recovery Strategies**:
1. **Sleep**: 7-9 hours per night (MOST IMPORTANT)
   - Prioritize sleep quality over all other recovery modalities
   - Poor sleep negates most other recovery efforts

2. **Nutrition**: Adequate calories and protein
   - Calorie surplus or maintenance for muscle gain
   - 1.6-2.2g protein per kg bodyweight
   - Hydration (monitor urine color - pale yellow)

3. **Deload weeks**: Programmed reduction in training stress
   - Most evidence-backed active recovery strategy
   - See deload-programming protocol

**Moderate-Impact Recovery Strategies**:
4. **Active recovery**: Light movement on rest days
   - Walking, easy cycling, swimming
   - Very low intensity (<50% max effort)
   - Helps blood flow without adding fatigue

5. **Mobility work**: Daily movement prep
   - Hip CARs, shoulder mobility
   - Addresses specific limitations
   - Can be done daily (very low stress)

**Low-Impact Recovery Strategies** (helpful but not essential):
6. **Massage**: May reduce soreness perception
   - Doesn't accelerate physiological recovery
   - Psychological benefit

7. **Stretching**: Static stretching post-workout
   - May reduce soreness slightly
   - Don't force aggressive stretching when very sore

8. **Cold therapy**: Ice baths, cold showers
   - May blunt adaptation if done immediately post-training
   - Better for acute injury management than routine recovery

**Priority Order**: Sleep > Nutrition > Deloads > Active Recovery > Mobility > Others

### Life Stress Integration

**High life stress = reduced recovery capacity**

Factors:
- Work stress (deadlines, long hours)
- Travel (sleep disruption, routine changes)
- Relationship stress
- Financial stress
- Major life events

**Adjustment Strategy**:
```
Normal life stress:
- Train as planned

Moderate life stress (1-2 major stressors):
- Reduce volume 10-20%
- Maintain intensity (keep loads heavy but reduce sets)
- Add 1 rest day if possible

High life stress (3+ major stressors or crisis):
- Reduce volume 30-50%
- Reduce intensity to RPE 7 max
- Consider maintenance mode (minimal effective dose)
- Prioritize sleep and nutrition over training volume
```

## Validation Criteria

### Must-Have Checks
✅ At least 1-2 complete rest days per week (more if needed)
✅ Deload weeks scheduled every 3-6 weeks of hard training
✅ Recovery time between high-stress sessions adequate (48+ hours for same muscle groups)
✅ Training frequency matches training age and goal
✅ Fatigue monitoring plan (check logs for performance/RPE trends)

### Warning Signs
⚠️ Zero rest days (overtraining risk)
⚠️ High-stress sessions on consecutive days (same muscle groups)
⚠️ No deload scheduled for >6 weeks
⚠️ Ignoring fatigue indicators in logs
⚠️ Very high training volume without recovery strategy

### Automatic Failures
❌ No rest days at all (training 7 days/week hard)
❌ Same muscle group trained hard <24 hours apart
❌ No deload strategy for >8 weeks continuous hard training
❌ Ignoring severe fatigue indicators (5+ symptoms)

## Cross-Check Points

- **progression.md** - Progression rate must match recovery capacity (can't progress if not recovering)
- **injury-prevention.md** - Inadequate recovery is primary injury risk factor
- **exercise-selection.md** - High-skill exercises require more recovery than simple movements

## Examples

### Example 1: Standard Recovery Strategy (Intermediate, 4x/week)
**Context**: 2 years training, 4x/week upper/lower split

**Recovery Plan**:
```
Mon: Lower (squat focus)
Tue: Upper (bench focus)
Wed: OFF (complete rest)
Thu: Lower (deadlift focus)
Fri: OFF (complete rest)
Sat: Upper (press + accessories)
Sun: Active recovery (walk, light mobility) or OFF

Deload: Week 4 of every 4-week block (reduce volume 50%)
Monitoring: Track RPE each session, if RPE >9 for 2 sessions, trigger deload
```

**Validation**:
- ✅ 2 complete rest days (Wed, Fri)
- ✅ 48-72 hours between same muscle groups (Mon lower → Thu lower)
- ✅ Deload every 4 weeks
- ✅ Fatigue monitoring via RPE

### Example 2: High Life Stress Adjustment
**Context**: User reports work deadline, poor sleep last 3 nights

**Adjustment**:
```
Planned: Lower squat 5x5 @ 245lbs (progression from last week)
Life stress: Work deadline, sleep 5-6 hours past 3 nights
Adjustment: Lower squat 3x5 @ 235lbs (reduce volume 40%, reduce load slightly)
Rationale: Maintain movement pattern, reduce stress, prioritize recovery
```

**Validation**:
- ✅ Responded to life stress appropriately
- ✅ Reduced volume and intensity
- ✅ Still provides stimulus (not complete skip)

### Example 3: Fatigue Indicators Triggering Deload
**Context**: User has been training hard for 5 weeks, last 2 sessions missed reps and RPE very high

**Decision**:
```
Indicators present:
- Performance decline (missed reps last 2 sessions)
- RPE creep (same weights feel harder)
- Soreness (still sore from 3 days ago)
- Motivation low (noted in logs)

Count: 4 moderate fatigue indicators
Decision: Trigger unscheduled deload week (volume 50%, intensity same)
Duration: 1 week, then return to normal training
```

**Validation**:
- ✅ Fatigue indicators identified correctly
- ✅ Appropriate response (deload)
- ✅ Proactive (before injury or illness)

### Example 4: Active Recovery Day Structure
**Context**: User has Sunday as rest day, wants to do something active

**Active Recovery Plan**:
```
30-40 minute walk (conversational pace, <50% effort)
10 minutes mobility:
- Hip CARs 2x5 each direction
- Shoulder circles 2x10
- Cat-cow 2x10
- Light hamstring/quad stretching
Optional: 5-10 minutes foam rolling sore areas

Avoid: Anything intense, heavy lifting, sprints, hard cardio
Goal: Movement without fatigue accumulation
```

**Validation**:
- ✅ Very low intensity (won't interfere with recovery)
- ✅ Promotes blood flow
- ✅ Addresses mobility needs
- ✅ No additional fatigue created

## Anti-Patterns

❌ **Training 7 days/week with no rest** - Recipe for overtraining
❌ **Skipping deloads because "feeling good"** - Fatigue is cumulative, often hits suddenly
❌ **Training same muscle group hard on consecutive days** - Insufficient recovery
❌ **Ignoring life stress** - Training volume should adapt to total stress
❌ **Relying on recovery modalities over rest** - Massage/ice baths can't replace sleep and deloads
❌ **No fatigue monitoring** - Flying blind, can't adjust if not tracking
❌ **Pushing through severe fatigue indicators** - Injury and illness risk
