# Recovery & Deload Protocols

## Purpose

Strategic reduction of training stress to allow supercompensation, dissipate accumulated fatigue, and prevent overtraining. Progressive training accumulates fatigue faster than it dissipates - muscle damage, nervous system stress, hormonal disruption, psychological strain all compound over weeks. Deload weeks intentionally reduce stimulus (50% volume/intensity/frequency) while maintaining movement patterns, allowing physiological systems to fully recover and adapt. Research shows athletes who incorporate planned deloads gain equal or greater strength/endurance vs those who train continuously, with significantly lower injury and burnout rates. Deloads are NOT weakness - they're strategic recovery that unlocks progress.

## Application

**When to apply:**
- **Scheduled (proactive):** Every 4-8 weeks of progressive training, regardless of how you feel
- **Reactive (responsive):** When biometric or performance signals indicate accumulated fatigue
- **After high-stress blocks:** Following competition, PR attempts, or particularly intense training phases

**Deload timing:**

**Scheduled intervals:**
- Beginner/intermediate: Every 6-8 weeks | Advanced: Every 4-6 weeks | Hybrid training: Every 6 weeks | Age 40+: Every 5-6 weeks

**Reactive triggers (deload if 2+ present):**
- Elevated resting HR (5-10 bpm above baseline, 3+ days)
- Poor sleep quality, performance plateau/regression
- Persistent muscle soreness (72+ hrs), decreased motivation
- Increased injury niggles, HRV trending downward (1+ week)

**Deload methods (choose ONE):**

1. **Volume reduction** (recommended): Reduce sets 50%, keep intensity/frequency same. Why: Maintains adaptations via load, reduces total stress. Example: 5×5 @ 225lb → 2-3×5 @ 225lb
2. **Intensity reduction:** Reduce load 40-50%, keep volume/frequency same. Why: Movement practice continues, tissue stress reduced. Example: 4×5 @ 225lb → 4×5 @ 115-135lb
3. **Frequency reduction:** Cut sessions in half, keep volume/intensity same. Why: Extra rest days. Example: 4x/week → 2x/week

**Active recovery (supplement deload):**
- Z1-2 cardio 20-30min (walking, easy cycling), mobility/yoga, skill practice (low intensity), leisure activities (hiking, play)

## Contraindications

**Do NOT deload if:**
- First 2-3 weeks new program (no fatigue accumulated)
- Recovering from illness/injury with no training (already detrained)
- Extended time off (week+ vacation) - return at reduced load instead

**Do NOT confuse with:**
- Complete rest week (deload = reduced training, NOT zero activity)
- Tapering (pre-competition peak, 1-3 weeks before event)
- Active recovery day (single easy day ≠ full deload week)

## Integration with Training

**Sequencing:**
- After 4-8 weeks progressive training (week 4/6/8)
- Before switching training blocks (strength→endurance transition)
- Post-competition (reactive deload often needed)

**Compatible with:** All training modalities, daily mobility (enhances recovery), prehab protocols (can increase)

**Modify if:**
- Reactive deload needed early → deload immediately (don't push to planned week)
- Feeling great at planned deload → mini-deload (30% volume, 3-4 days)
- Still fatigued after deload → extend another week (may signal overtraining)

## Common Errors

**"Skipping deloads because feeling strong"** - Fatigue accumulates invisibly; when you FEEL it (performance drop, injury), you're already overtrained. Scheduled deloads prevent this by proactively recovering before hitting the wall. Many report hitting PRs during or immediately after deload (supercompensation - body finally adapts when stress removed). Correct: Trust the schedule, deload even when feeling good - you'll come back stronger.

**"Complete rest during deload week (zero training)"** - Complete cessation of training for 7 days leads to rapid detraining (strength drops ~5-10%, endurance drops ~10-15% in 1 week). Deload should maintain stimulus at lower dose, not eliminate it. Blood flow from movement aids recovery better than sedentary rest. Correct: Reduce volume/intensity 50%, still train 2-4x/week with lighter loads or shorter sessions.

**"Deloading too frequently (every 2-3 weeks)"** - Doesn't allow enough progressive overload stimulus to accumulate before backing off. Adaptations require sustained stress over 4-6+ weeks; deloading too often means never pushing hard enough to progress. Results: spinning wheels, no gains. Correct: Minimum 4 weeks between deloads (unless reactive signals appear), typically 6-8 weeks for optimal balance.

**"Only reducing one modality during hybrid training deload"** - If training both strength and endurance, both contribute to systemic fatigue. Deloading only running while continuing heavy lifting (or vice versa) doesn't allow full recovery. Central nervous system, hormonal system, sleep quality all impacted by total training stress. Correct: Reduce BOTH modalities during deload week (50% volume in strength AND endurance).

**"Using deload as excuse for poor programming"** - Needing reactive deloads every 3-4 weeks signals program too aggressive (too much volume, intensity, or frequency). Deloads should be scheduled every 6-8 weeks; if constantly needing earlier deloads, training plan is unsustainable. Correct: Reduce baseline training volume/intensity 10-20% to create sustainable program that only needs scheduled deloads.

## Application Checklist

- [ ] Minimum 4 weeks of progressive training completed (deload not needed if starting new program)
- [ ] Scheduled deload approaching (week 4, 6, or 8 of current block) OR 2+ reactive triggers present
- [ ] Deload method selected (volume reduction recommended for most)
- [ ] Volume/intensity/frequency reduced by ~50% from normal training
- [ ] Active recovery planned (easy movement, mobility, leisure activities supplement reduced training)
- [ ] NOT complete rest (still training 2-4x/week at reduced load)
- [ ] Tracking recovery signals (sleep, resting HR, subjective energy) to confirm deload effectiveness
- [ ] Plan to return to normal training post-deload (resume progression where left off, not restart)
