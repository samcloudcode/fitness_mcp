# Knee Health & Injury Prevention

## Purpose

Strengthening muscles around the knee joint (quads, hamstrings, glutes, calves, tibialis anterior) to create shock absorption and stability. Strong quads stabilize the patella and control knee extension, hamstrings protect the ACL by resisting anterior tibial translation, glutes (especially glute medius) prevent valgus collapse during single-leg movements, and lower leg muscles absorb impact forces. Focused strengthening distributes forces away from joint structures, preventing overload on cartilage and ligaments.

Full range-of-motion training (including knees-over-toes movements) builds tissue tolerance at deep flexion angles. Restricting knee forward travel shifts stress to hips/back; allowing natural knee movement distributes load safely across the joint. Progressive exposure adapts tissues, increasing load capacity without pain.

## Application

**When to apply:**
- Injury prevention for squatting, running, jumping athletes
- Addressing single-leg instability or valgus collapse patterns
- Post-injury rehab (after acute inflammation subsides, physician clearance)

**How to apply:**
- **Duration**: 10-15 min daily (adapt to time constraints: 5 min minimum effective dose)
- **Example 8-exercise circuit** (customize based on individual needs, equipment, time):
  1. Backward walk/sled pull: 2-3 min warmup (activates VMO, low joint stress)
  2. Tibialis raises: 3×15-20 (deceleration control, shin balance)
  3. Deep squat OR ATG split squat: 2×8-12 (full ROM quad strength)
  4. Nordic curls OR hamstring bridge: 2×5-8 (eccentric hamstring, ACL protection)
  5. Lateral band walks: 2×10-15 steps (glute medius, prevent valgus)
  6. Bent-knee calf raises: 2×15+ (soleus, knee flexion support)
  7. Single-leg control drill: 1-2×5-8/leg (balance, stability)
  8. Hip mobility: 1-2 min (external rotation for deep positions)
- **Time-constrained priority (5 min)**: Backward walk (2 min) + Tibialis raises (1 set) + Lateral band walks (2 sets)
- **Individual adaptations**: Select exercises addressing specific weaknesses (valgus collapse → prioritize #3-5, shin splints → prioritize #2+6, single-leg instability → prioritize #7)
- **Timing**: As warmup before lower body training, standalone on rest days, or post-workout finisher (avoid pre-endurance work)
- **Progression**: Increase depth, then resistance, then single-leg variants. Progress every 1-2 weeks if pain-free.

**Dosage ranges:**
- **Frequency**: Daily ideal, minimum 3-4×/week
- **Volume**: Start 10 min, build to 15 min as tolerance improves
- **Intensity**: Bodyweight → light resistance → moderate loads. Never sacrifice form for load.

## Contraindications

**Do NOT apply if:**
- Acute knee inflammation with visible swelling (exercise worsens swelling)
- Sharp, shooting, or severe pain during movement (tissue damage signal)
- Recent traumatic injury with "pop" sensation (possible ligament/meniscus tear)
- Fever or infection signs (systemic stress contraindicated)

**Warning signs to stop/modify:**
- Sharp pain during exercise (vs. muscle burn) - stop immediately
- Increased swelling or delayed pain next day - reduce volume/intensity by 50%
- Joint line tenderness or effusion - possible delayed healing, consult physician

## Integration with Training

**Sequencing:**
- As warmup before lower body training (activates stabilizers)
- Standalone on rest days (maintains knee resilience without systemic fatigue)
- Post-workout finisher (15 min cap to avoid overtraining)

**Compatible with:**
- Squats, deadlifts, lunges (complements rather than competes)
- Running, jumping, yoga (addresses weak links in primary training)
- Strength programs 4-6×/week (low systemic stress allows daily use)

**Reduce if:**
- Accumulated soreness from main training (prioritize recovery)
- Sharp pain appears (regress to pain-free exercises only)
- Travel/time constraints (maintain 5 min minimum with 3 key exercises: backward walk, tibialis raises, lateral band walks)

## Common Errors

**"Letting knees cave inward during squats/lunges (valgus collapse)"** - Weak hip abductors fail to control femur rotation, forcing knee into vulnerable position that stresses ACL and medial meniscus. Correct: Strengthen glute medius with lateral band walks, cue "knees out" during all movements, ensure knee tracks over 2nd-3rd toe.

**"Using too-light resistance for hip abduction work"** - Band walks with minimal tension feel easy but provide insufficient stimulus for strength gains. Glutes need challenging loads to adapt. Correct: Use thick bands or double loops until you feel significant burn by rep 10, progress to single-leg variants for greater challenge.

**"Neglecting tibialis anterior while doing calf raises"** - Creates imbalanced lower leg where strong plantarflexors overpower weak dorsiflexors, increasing knee stress during deceleration (running, landing). Correct: Match calf work 1:1 with tibialis raises, prioritize shin strength for athletes with running/jumping demands.

**"Forcing deep range-of-motion without progressive adaptation"** - Jumping into ATG squats or split squats under load before tissues adapt to deep flexion angles risks pain or re-injury. Tissue tolerance builds gradually. Correct: Start shallow, add 5-10° depth every 1-2 weeks, use heel elevation or assistance until full depth is pain-free, then add resistance.

**"Continuing through sharp pain because 'no pain no gain'"** - Sharp, shooting pain signals tissue damage, not productive training stimulus. Ignoring it worsens injury. Muscle burn (dull, diffuse) is normal; joint pain (sharp, localized) is not. Correct: Stop immediately if sharp pain occurs, regress to pain-free variation, distinguish muscle fatigue from joint distress.

## Application Checklist

- [ ] No acute swelling or inflammation (knee appears/feels normal)
- [ ] No sharp pain during daily activities (stairs, walking comfortable)
- [ ] Cleared by physician if post-injury or post-surgery
- [ ] Can perform bodyweight squat to 90° without pain (baseline mobility check)
- [ ] Hip mobility adequate for chosen exercises (can externally rotate without knee twist)
- [ ] Consistent 3-4×/week minimum (daily ideal for adaptation)
- [ ] Progressive loading planned (depth → resistance → single-leg over 4-8 weeks)
- [ ] Pain signals monitored (stop if sharp pain, adjust if delayed soreness)
