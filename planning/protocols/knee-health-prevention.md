# Knee Health & Injury Prevention

## Purpose

Strengthening muscles around the knee joint (quads, hamstrings, glutes, calves, tibialis anterior) to create shock absorption and stability. Strong quads stabilize the patella and control knee extension, hamstrings protect the ACL by resisting anterior tibial translation, glutes (especially glute medius) prevent valgus collapse during single-leg movements, and lower leg muscles absorb impact forces. Focused strengthening distributes forces away from joint structures, preventing overload on cartilage and ligaments.

Full range-of-motion training (including knees-over-toes movements) builds tissue tolerance at deep flexion angles. Restricting knee forward travel shifts stress to hips/back; allowing natural knee movement distributes load safely across the joint. Progressive exposure adapts tissues, increasing load capacity without pain.

## Application

**When to apply:**
- Injury prevention for squatting, running, jumping athletes
- Addressing single-leg instability or valgus collapse patterns
- Post-injury rehab (after acute inflammation subsides, physician clearance)

**How to apply:**
- **Duration**: 10-15 min daily (adapt to time constraints: 5 min minimum effective dose)
- **Example 8-exercise circuit** (customize based on individual needs, equipment, time):

  1. **Backward walk/sled pull:** 2-3 min continuous at moderate pace
     - **Purpose:** "Gentle strength training" for knees - activates VMO (vastus medialis obliquus, teardrop quad muscle) without eccentric shock
     - **Execution:** Walk backward on treadmill (incline optional), OR drag sled with straps/rope backward pulling
     - **Load:** Bodyweight (treadmill) or light sled (15-45lbs) - should feel work in quads without strain
     - **Why it works:** Pumps blood/nutrients into knee joint (nourishing cartilage/meniscus), strengthens quads through full range, zero impact (no eccentric landing forces), Ben Patrick calls it "almost magical" for knee rehab
     - **Progression:** Start 1-2 min, build to 3-5 min as tolerance improves

  2. **Tibialis raises:** 3×20-25 reps (Ben Patrick dosage for runners/jumpers)
     - **Purpose:** Strengthen front of shin (tibialis anterior) - critical for deceleration, absorbs landing forces, prevents shin splints
     - **Execution:** Lean back against wall, feet flat, lift toes toward shins (dorsiflexion), hold 1s at top, control down
     - **Load:** Bodyweight initially, add weight vest or hold DB on thighs when 25 reps easy
     - **Why it works:** Most training strengthens calves (plantarflexion) but neglects tibialis - imbalance increases knee stress during running/landing. Strengthening tibialis helps knee track properly
     - **Frequency:** 2-3x/week minimum, daily ideal (recovers quickly, low fatigue)

  3. **ATG Split Squat:** 2×8-12 per leg (progress depth gradually over weeks/months)
     - **Purpose:** Deep knee flexion strength + hip flexor lengthening in rear leg
     - **Execution:** Back foot elevated (bench/box 12-18"), front knee travels FORWARD over toes as you descend (ATG = "ass to grass" depth), rear knee bends/lowers toward ground, torso upright
     - **Progression path (critical - don't rush):**
       - Week 1-4: Partial depth (thigh parallel), bodyweight or holding pole for balance
       - Week 5-8: Below parallel depth, add light DB in goblet position
       - Week 9-12: Full depth (rear knee near ground), increase DB load
       - Month 4+: Full depth with heavier DBs or barbell
     - **Why it works:** Develops immense VMO strength at deep knee angles, conditions patellar tendon through full ROM, lengthens hip flexors of rear leg (tight hip flexors pull pelvis forward, affecting knee alignment)
     - **Key cue:** Front knee MUST travel forward over toes (don't restrict knee motion) - strengthens end-range, builds tolerance

  4. **Nordic curls OR hamstring bridge:** 2×5-8 (eccentric hamstring, ACL protection)
     - **Purpose:** Strengthen hamstrings (especially eccentric strength) to protect ACL by resisting anterior tibial translation (forward sliding of shin bone)
     - **Execution (Nordic):** Kneel with ankles anchored, slowly lower body forward (eccentric control), catch with hands, push back to start
     - **Execution (Bridge):** Lie on back, heels on bench, lift hips, curl heels toward glutes, control extension
     - **Why it works:** Hamstrings counterbalance quad pull on knee - strong posterior chain prevents ACL strain during deceleration/cutting

  5. **Lateral band walks:** 2×10-15 steps each direction (glute medius, prevent valgus)
     - **Purpose:** Strengthen hip abductors (glute medius) to prevent knee valgus collapse (knees caving inward)
     - **Execution:** Band around thighs/knees, quarter squat position, step laterally maintaining tension, knees pushed outward against band
     - **Load:** Thick band or double loop (should feel significant burn by rep 10 - light bands insufficient stimulus)
     - **Why it works:** Weak glute medius fails to control femur rotation, forcing knee into vulnerable valgus position that stresses ACL and medial meniscus

  6. **Bent-knee calf raises (Soleus emphasis):** 2×15-20 reps
     - **Purpose:** Strengthen soleus (deep calf muscle that fires when knee bent) - critical for endurance running and knee support
     - **Execution:** Knees BENT ~45°, raise onto toes (plantarflexion), control down. Can do on slant board or step with knees forward over toes for greater ROM
     - **Why different from straight-leg calf raises:** Bent knee recruits soleus preferentially (vs gastrocnemius with straight leg). Soleus is postural muscle, endurance-oriented, fires continuously during running when knee flexed
     - **For runners:** Match calf volume 1:1 with tibialis work (both front and back of lower leg need equal strength)

  7. **Single-leg control drill:** 1-2×5-8/leg (balance, stability)
     - **Purpose:** Develop single-leg stability and proprioception
     - **Execution:** Single-leg RDL, step-ups, pistol squat progressions, or single-leg balance with perturbations
     - **Why it works:** Most knee injuries occur during single-leg loading (running, jumping, cutting) - training single-leg control prevents collapse patterns

  8. **Hip mobility:** 1-2 min (external rotation for deep positions)
     - **Purpose:** Adequate hip mobility allows deep squat positions without knee compensation
     - **Execution:** 90/90 hip stretch, pigeon pose, frog stretch
     - **Why it works:** Limited hip external rotation forces knee to twist inward to achieve depth - hip mobility allows natural knee tracking

- **Time-constrained priority (5 min)**: Backward walk/sled (2 min) + Tibialis raises (1×20-25) + Lateral band walks (2×10-15 steps)
- **Individual adaptations**: Select exercises addressing specific weaknesses (valgus collapse → prioritize #3-5, shin splints → prioritize #2+6, single-leg instability → prioritize #7)
- **Timing**: As warmup before lower body training, standalone on rest days, or post-workout finisher (avoid immediately pre-endurance work - save legs for running)
- **Progression**: ATG splits → increase depth over 8-12 weeks, then add load. Sled → increase duration before adding weight. Tibialis/soleus → increase reps to 25-30, then add load

**Dosage ranges:**
- **Frequency**: Daily ideal, minimum 3-4×/week
- **Volume**: Start 10 min, build to 15 min as tolerance improves
- **Intensity**: Bodyweight → light resistance → moderate loads. Never sacrifice form for load.

## Contraindications

**Do NOT apply if:**
- Acute knee inflammation with visible swelling (exercise worsens swelling)
- Sharp, shooting, or severe pain during movement (tissue damage signal)
- Recent traumatic injury with "pop" sensation (possible ligament/meniscus tear)
- Fever or infection signs (systemic stress contraindicated)

**Warning signs to stop/modify:**
- Sharp pain during exercise (vs. muscle burn) - stop immediately
- Increased swelling or delayed pain next day - reduce volume/intensity by 50%
- Joint line tenderness or effusion - possible delayed healing, consult physician

## Integration with Training

**Sequencing:**
- As warmup before lower body training (activates stabilizers)
- Standalone on rest days (maintains knee resilience without systemic fatigue)
- Post-workout finisher (15 min cap to avoid overtraining)

**Compatible with:**
- Squats, deadlifts, lunges (complements rather than competes)
- Running, jumping, yoga (addresses weak links in primary training)
- Strength programs 4-6×/week (low systemic stress allows daily use)

**Reduce if:**
- Accumulated soreness from main training (prioritize recovery)
- Sharp pain appears (regress to pain-free exercises only)
- Travel/time constraints (maintain 5 min minimum with 3 key exercises: backward walk, tibialis raises, lateral band walks)

## Common Errors

**"Letting knees cave inward during squats/lunges (valgus collapse)"** - Weak hip abductors fail to control femur rotation, forcing knee into vulnerable position that stresses ACL and medial meniscus. Correct: Strengthen glute medius with lateral band walks, cue "knees out" during all movements, ensure knee tracks over 2nd-3rd toe.

**"Using too-light resistance for hip abduction work"** - Band walks with minimal tension feel easy but provide insufficient stimulus for strength gains. Glutes need challenging loads to adapt. Correct: Use thick bands or double loops until you feel significant burn by rep 10, progress to single-leg variants for greater challenge.

**"Neglecting tibialis anterior while doing calf raises"** - Creates imbalanced lower leg where strong plantarflexors overpower weak dorsiflexors, increasing knee stress during deceleration (running, landing). Correct: Match calf work 1:1 with tibialis raises, prioritize shin strength for athletes with running/jumping demands.

**"Forcing deep range-of-motion without progressive adaptation"** - Jumping into ATG squats or split squats under load before tissues adapt to deep flexion angles risks pain or re-injury. Tissue tolerance builds gradually. Correct: Start shallow, add 5-10° depth every 1-2 weeks, use heel elevation or assistance until full depth is pain-free, then add resistance.

**"Continuing through sharp pain because 'no pain no gain'"** - Sharp, shooting pain signals tissue damage, not productive training stimulus. Ignoring it worsens injury. Muscle burn (dull, diffuse) is normal; joint pain (sharp, localized) is not. Correct: Stop immediately if sharp pain occurs, regress to pain-free variation, distinguish muscle fatigue from joint distress.
