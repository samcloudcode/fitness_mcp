# Progression Protocol

## Purpose

Provides evidence-based frameworks for systematically increasing training stress over time to drive adaptation. Covers load progression, volume progression, intensity management, and periodization strategies appropriate for different training ages and goals.

## When to Use

- Designing program progression schemes (program-creator)
- Calculating workout loads from previous sessions (workout-creator)
- Determining if progression is appropriate or if adjustment needed (week-planner, workout-creator)
- Assessing training logs for progression trends

## Decision Framework

### Core Progression Principle

**Progressive Overload**: Gradually increase training stress over time through:
1. Load (weight lifted)
2. Volume (sets × reps)
3. Intensity (proximity to failure, RPE)
4. Frequency (sessions per week)
5. Density (work per unit time)

**Key Rule**: Change ONE variable at a time for clearest signal and safest progression.

### Progression Schemes by Training Age

**Beginner (0-1 year consistent training)**

Characteristics:
- Rapid adaptation potential (neurological gains)
- Can progress almost every session
- Recovery is fast
- Limited work capacity

Recommended scheme: **Linear Progression**
```
Structure:
- Session to session load increases
- Add weight when target reps achieved
- Increase: 2.5-5lbs upper body, 5-10lbs lower body per session
- Reset and build up when stall (3 consecutive failures)

Example:
Week 1: Squat 3x5 @ 135lbs
Week 2: Squat 3x5 @ 145lbs (+10lbs)
Week 3: Squat 3x5 @ 155lbs (+10lbs)
Week 4: Squat 3x5 @ 165lbs (+10lbs)
[If fail week 5, deload to 155lbs and build back up]
```

**Intermediate (1-3 years consistent training)**

Characteristics:
- Slower adaptation (past neurological phase)
- Can progress weekly (not every session)
- Need more volume for stimulus
- Better work capacity

Recommended schemes: **Weekly Linear or Wave Loading**

*Option 1: Weekly Linear*
```
Structure:
- Week to week load increases
- Multiple sessions per week at same weight
- Increase weekly: 2.5-5lbs
- Deload every 4-6 weeks

Example:
Week 1: Mon/Fri Squat 3x5 @ 225lbs
Week 2: Mon/Fri Squat 3x5 @ 230lbs
Week 3: Mon/Fri Squat 3x5 @ 235lbs
Week 4: Mon/Fri Squat 3x5 @ 225lbs (deload)
```

*Option 2: Wave Loading*
```
Structure:
- Undulating intensity within week
- Heavy/Medium/Light or similar pattern
- Progress wave to wave (every 2-3 weeks)

Example:
Week 1: Mon Heavy 3x3 @ 245lbs, Thu Light 3x6 @ 205lbs
Week 2: Mon Medium 3x4 @ 225lbs, Thu Heavy 3x3 @ 250lbs
Week 3: Mon Light 3x6 @ 215lbs, Thu Medium 3x4 @ 230lbs
```

**Advanced (3+ years consistent training)**

Characteristics:
- Slow adaptation (near genetic potential in some lifts)
- Progress monthly or by block
- High volume tolerance and requirement
- Complex periodization needed

Recommended scheme: **Block Periodization**
```
Structure:
- Distinct training blocks (4-6 weeks each)
- Each block emphasizes different quality
- Blocks build on each other
- Deload between blocks

Example:
Block 1 (4 weeks): Hypertrophy - 4x10 @ 60-70% (build work capacity)
Deload week
Block 2 (4 weeks): Strength - 5x5 @ 75-85% (convert mass to strength)
Deload week
Block 3 (4 weeks): Peaking - 3x3 @ 85-92% (express strength)
Deload week, then test
```

### Progression Calculation Methods

**Method 1: Fixed Increment**
- Add predetermined weight when reps achieved
- Best for: Beginners, linear progression
- Example: "Add 5lbs when you complete 3x5"

**Method 2: RPE-Based (Auto-regulation)**
- Progress based on proximity to failure
- Best for: Intermediate/advanced, when recovery variable
- Logic:
  - If RPE < 7: Add weight next session
  - If RPE 7-8.5: Repeat weight or add 1 rep
  - If RPE > 8.5: Reduce weight or volume

Example:
```
Session 1: Squat 3x5 @ 225lbs RPE 7 → Too easy
Session 2: Squat 3x5 @ 235lbs RPE 8 → Good, progress
Session 3: Squat 3x5 @ 245lbs RPE 9 → Too hard, reduce next time
Session 4: Squat 3x5 @ 235lbs RPE 7.5 → Back on track
```

**Method 3: Percentage-Based**
- Calculate from 1RM or training max (TM)
- Best for: Structured programs, peaking phases
- Common: Training Max = 90% of 1RM, work from TM percentages

Example (using Training Max of 300lbs):
```
Week 1: 3x5 @ 85% TM = 255lbs
Week 2: 3x5 @ 87.5% TM = 262.5lbs
Week 3: 3x5 @ 90% TM = 270lbs
Week 4: 3x5 @ 82.5% TM = 247.5lbs (deload)
```

**Method 4: Double Progression**
- Increase reps within range, then increase weight
- Best for: Hypertrophy, accessory movements
- Logic: Hit top of rep range across all sets → increase weight, drop back to bottom of range

Example:
```
Week 1: 3x8 @ 135lbs (hit 8 reps on all sets)
Week 2: 3x10 @ 135lbs (progress reps)
Week 3: 3x12 @ 135lbs (hit top of range)
Week 4: 3x8 @ 145lbs (increase weight, back to 8 reps)
```

### Volume Progression

**Volume Landmarks** (from Israetel et al.):
- **MV (Maintenance Volume)**: Minimum to maintain gains
- **MEV (Minimum Effective Volume)**: Minimum to make progress
- **MAV (Maximum Adaptive Volume)**: Optimal for most gains
- **MRV (Maximum Recoverable Volume)**: Ceiling before overtraining

**Progression Logic**:
1. Start at MEV
2. Add sets each week (1-2 sets per muscle group)
3. Continue until approaching MRV or performance declines
4. Deload (drop back to MEV or below)
5. Repeat cycle with higher MEV baseline

**Example** (for a muscle group):
```
Week 1: 10 sets/week (MEV)
Week 2: 12 sets/week
Week 3: 14 sets/week
Week 4: 16 sets/week (approaching MRV, fatigue high)
Week 5: 6 sets/week (deload to below MEV)
Week 6: 12 sets/week (restart at higher MEV)
```

### When to Progress vs Repeat vs Reduce

**Progress** (increase load/volume/intensity):
✅ Hit target reps/sets across all work sets
✅ RPE at or below target (e.g., RPE 7-8 as planned)
✅ Good recovery (sleep, soreness manageable)
✅ Movement quality maintained

**Repeat** (same stimulus):
⚠️ Hit most but not all target reps (e.g., 5/5/4 instead of 5/5/5)
⚠️ RPE slightly higher than target but manageable (RPE 8.5 vs 8 target)
⚠️ Recovery adequate but not great

**Reduce** (decrease load/volume/intensity or deload):
❌ Missed multiple reps across sets
❌ RPE excessively high (>9 when target was 8)
❌ Poor recovery (bad sleep, high soreness, life stress)
❌ Performance declining 2+ sessions

## Validation Criteria

### Must-Have Checks
✅ Progression scheme matches training age (linear for beginners, periodized for advanced)
✅ Loads calculated from recent training logs (not arbitrary)
✅ Progression rate appropriate (not too aggressive - max 5-10% load increase week to week)
✅ Deload weeks scheduled (every 3-6 weeks depending on training age)
✅ Auto-regulation cues included (RPE targets or "if X then Y" logic)

### Warning Signs
⚠️ Load increases >10% week to week (injury risk)
⚠️ No deload scheduled for >6 weeks hard training (fatigue accumulation)
⚠️ Beginner on complex periodization (unnecessarily complicated)
⚠️ Advanced lifter on session-to-session linear (won't work past novice stage)
⚠️ Progression without checking recent logs (no baseline)

### Automatic Failures
❌ No progression scheme defined (static programming)
❌ Progression ignores recent performance (arbitrary loads)
❌ Excessive progression (>15% load increase)
❌ No deload strategy (recipe for overtraining)

## Cross-Check Points

- **recovery-management.md** - Ensure progression rate sustainable with recovery capacity
- **injury-prevention.md** - Verify progression doesn't create injury risk (overuse, excessive load jumps)
- **exercise-selection.md** - Some exercises have limited progression potential (very heavy dumbbell rows vs barbell rows)

## Examples

### Example 1: Beginner Linear Progression
**Context**: 6 months training, currently squatting 135lbs 3x5

**Progression Plan**:
```
Current: Squat 3x5 @ 135lbs (RPE 7)
Next session: If complete all 3x5, add 10lbs → 145lbs
Continue: +10lbs per session until stall
Stall protocol: If miss reps 3 sessions in a row, deload 10% and build back up
```

**Validation**:
- ✅ Linear progression appropriate for beginner
- ✅ 10lbs increment reasonable for squat
- ✅ Based on current performance (135lbs)
- ✅ Deload strategy defined

### Example 2: Intermediate RPE-Based Progression
**Context**: 2 years training, bench 185lbs for 5x5 last session at RPE 8

**Progression Plan**:
```
Last: Bench 5x5 @ 185lbs RPE 8
Analysis: RPE 8 is target sweet spot, ready to progress
Next: Bench 5x5 @ 190lbs RPE 7-8
Logic: Small jump (5lbs), monitor RPE. If RPE >9, back off.
```

**Validation**:
- ✅ RPE-based appropriate for intermediate
- ✅ 5lbs (2.7%) increment conservative
- ✅ Based on last session's RPE
- ✅ Auto-regulation built in

### Example 3: Advanced Block Periodization
**Context**: 5 years training, planning 12-week strength mesocycle

**Progression Plan**:
```
Block 1 (Weeks 1-4): Hypertrophy
- Squat 4x8 @ 65-70% TM, add 1 set per week
- Week 1: 4x8, Week 2: 5x8, Week 3: 6x8, Week 4: deload

Block 2 (Weeks 5-8): Strength
- Squat 4x5 @ 75-82.5% TM, wave loading
- Week 5: 75%, Week 6: 80%, Week 7: 82.5%, Week 8: deload

Block 3 (Weeks 9-12): Peak
- Squat 3x3 @ 85-90% TM
- Week 9: 85%, Week 10: 87.5%, Week 11: 90%, Week 12: taper
```

**Validation**:
- ✅ Block periodization appropriate for advanced
- ✅ Clear progression within and between blocks
- ✅ Deload weeks every 4 weeks
- ✅ Builds toward peak (hypertrophy → strength → expression)

### Example 4: Adjusting for Poor Recovery
**Context**: User planned to squat 245lbs but logged poor sleep and high fatigue

**Adjustment**:
```
Planned: Squat 3x5 @ 245lbs (progression from 240lbs last week)
Situation: Poor sleep, noted high fatigue in recent logs
Adjustment: Squat 3x5 @ 235lbs (repeat from 2 weeks ago at lower RPE)
Rationale: Auto-regulate down due to poor recovery, focus on quality
```

**Validation**:
- ✅ Responded to recovery status
- ✅ Reduced load proactively (injury prevention)
- ✅ Still provides stimulus (not complete rest)

## Anti-Patterns

❌ **Arbitrary loads not based on recent logs** - "Let's try 225lbs today" without checking previous performance
❌ **Progressing every session as advanced lifter** - Not sustainable past beginner phase
❌ **Excessive jumps** - Adding 20lbs to squat session to session
❌ **No deload strategy** - "Just keep adding weight until I can't"
❌ **Ignoring RPE/performance signals** - "I planned 245lbs so I'm doing 245lbs" (even if fatigue is high)
❌ **Changing multiple variables** - Adding weight AND reps AND sets simultaneously
❌ **Beginner on complex periodization** - Unnecessary when simple linear works
❌ **No progression at all** - Same weights week after week despite good performance
