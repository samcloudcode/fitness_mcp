# Concurrent Training

Managing multiple training goals simultaneously (strength + endurance, multiple sports, etc.)

---

## The Interference Effect

**Core Problem**: Endurance training can interfere with strength and hypertrophy adaptations

**Why It Happens**:
- Endurance training creates systemic fatigue
- Competing metabolic signals (AMPK vs mTOR pathways)
- Recovery resources are finite
- Hard cardio before lifting reduces lifting performance

**Key Finding**: Interference is real but manageable with smart programming

## Concurrent Training Principles

### 1. Prioritize Based on Goals

**If strength is primary**:
- Strength training 3-4x/week
- Cardio 1-3x/week, mostly low-intensity
- Keep cardio volume moderate (< 2 hours/week)

**If endurance is primary**:
- Cardio 4-6x/week
- Strength training 2-3x/week, maintenance dose
- Focus strength work on injury prevention and power

**If both are important (concurrent)**:
- Strength 3x/week
- Cardio 3-4x/week
- Requires careful management (see strategies below)

### 2. Separate Hard Sessions

**Minimum 6 hours between strength and hard cardio**
- AM strength, PM easy cardio = OK
- AM hard intervals, PM strength = BAD (fatigue from cardio hurts strength)
- AM strength, PM hard intervals = ACCEPTABLE (order matters)

**If must train twice in one day**:
- Strength first, cardio second (prioritize neural freshness)
- Keep cardio easy if doing both

### 3. Use Polarized Training for Cardio

**80/20 Rule**: 80% easy cardio, 20% hard intervals

**Easy cardio** (Zone 2):
- Conversational pace
- Builds aerobic base
- Doesn't interfere with strength
- Can be done often (even on strength days)

**Hard intervals** (VO2 or threshold):
- Once or twice per week max
- Treat like strength session for recovery planning
- Separate from heavy strength days

### 4. Manage Total Training Stress

**Don't have too many hard days**
- 3-4 hard sessions per week total (strength + intervals)
- If lifting 3 hard days, only 1 hard cardio day
- Easy cardio doesn't count as "hard day"
- Recovery days are part of the program

## Sequencing Strategies

### Option 1: Alternating Days
- **Mon**: Strength (upper)
- **Tue**: Easy cardio (Zone 2)
- **Wed**: Strength (lower)
- **Thu**: Hard intervals (VO2)
- **Fri**: Strength (full body)
- **Sat**: Long easy cardio
- **Sun**: Rest

**Pros**: Clear separation, full recovery between modalities
**Cons**: Requires 6 training days

### Option 2: Same-Day Training (AM/PM Split)
- **Mon**: AM strength, PM easy cardio
- **Tue**: Easy cardio only
- **Wed**: AM strength, PM easy cardio
- **Thu**: Hard intervals only
- **Fri**: AM strength
- **Sat**: Long easy cardio
- **Sun**: Rest

**Pros**: Fewer training days, easy cardio aids recovery
**Cons**: Requires twice-daily training, more time commitment

### Option 3: Strength Priority with Minimal Cardio
- **Mon**: Strength
- **Tue**: Easy cardio
- **Wed**: Strength
- **Thu**: Rest or easy cardio
- **Fri**: Strength
- **Sat**: Easy cardio or intervals (1x/week)
- **Sun**: Rest

**Pros**: Maximizes strength gains, maintains cardio fitness
**Cons**: Won't optimize endurance performance

## Exercise Selection for Concurrent Training

### Lower Body Considerations
- **Heavy squats + long runs** = difficult recovery
- **RDLs, step-ups, single-leg work** = less fatiguing than bilateral squats
- **Cycling** may interfere less than running (no impact)

### Upper Body Less Affected
- Upper body strength less impacted by cardio
- Can train upper body hard even when doing cardio

### Bodyweight Matters
- Heavier athletes struggle more with running
- Extra muscle mass = harder endurance work
- Cycling or rowing better for heavier individuals

---

## Nutrition for Concurrent Training

### Fuel Appropriately
- **Strength sessions**: Can be fasted or fed, preference varies
- **Hard cardio**: Usually needs carbs before/during
- **Long endurance**: Definitely needs fuel
- **Both in one day**: Prioritize carbs around training windows

### Protein Needs Higher
- 1.6-2.2 g/kg bodyweight (standard for strength)
- Add 10-20% for concurrent training
- Recovery demands from both modalities

### Calorie Balance
- Building muscle while improving endurance = difficult
- Maintenance calories usually best
- Slight surplus if strength is priority
- Slight deficit possible if endurance is priority and experienced

## Red Flags (Doing Too Much)

### Signs of Overtraining
- Strength going backward
- Cardio performance declining
- Persistent soreness (even after rest days)
- Poor sleep quality
- Elevated resting heart rate
- Loss of motivation
- Getting sick frequently

### If Overtraining Occurs
1. **Take a deload week** (reduce volume 50%)
2. **Remove one hard session** (usually the hard cardio)
3. **Add a rest day**
4. **Reassess priorities** (trying to do too much?)

## Sport-Specific Considerations

### Strength + Running
- **Running impact is high** - harder to recover from than cycling
- **Limit running volume** if strength is priority (< 20 miles/week)
- **Use cycling** for extra cardio if needed
- **Nordic curls, RDLs** help prevent hamstring injuries

### Strength + Cycling
- **Less interference** than running (no impact)
- **Quad-heavy** - may compete with squat recovery
- **Can handle more volume** while staying strong
- **Upper body unaffected**

### Strength + Swimming
- **Least interference** of endurance sports
- **Upper body fatigue** can affect pressing movements
- **Shoulder health** requires attention (read SHOULDER-HEALTH.md)

### Strength + Combat Sports/Martial Arts
- **High skill and conditioning demands**
- **Treat hard sparring like strength day** for recovery planning
- **Keep strength work to 2-3x/week**
- **Focus on explosive power** and injury prevention

## Research-Backed Strategies

### 1. Separate Upper and Lower
- Cardio doesn't interfere with upper body strength
- Program upper body strength on cardio days
- Save lower body strength for non-cardio days

### 2. Keep Cardio Intensity Low
- Zone 2 cardio (60-70% max HR) doesn't interfere
- High-intensity intervals (85-95% max HR) do interfere
- Most cardio should be conversational pace

### 3. Prioritize Strength if Building Muscle
- Add cardio gradually (don't go 0 to 4 days/week)
- Start with 1-2 easy sessions, add more slowly
- More cardio = harder to build muscle

### 4. Use "Minimum Effective Dose"
- **Maintain strength**: 2 sessions/week, < 6 hard sets per muscle
- **Maintain cardio**: 2-3 sessions/week, mostly easy
- Don't do more than needed if trying to balance both

## When to Load This File

Load CONCURRENT-TRAINING.md when:
- User has multiple training goals (strength + endurance, sport + lifting, etc.)
- Programming workouts for someone doing cardio and weights
- User asks about running/cycling while building strength
- User reports feeling overtrained from doing too much
- Creating a program entry for someone with concurrent goals

**Important**: Adjust strategies based on user's specific priorities from their goals and preferences. What works depends heavily on which adaptation matters most.
