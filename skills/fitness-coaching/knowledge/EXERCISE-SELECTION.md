# Exercise Selection Principles

Framework for choosing exercises based on goals, equipment, and individual factors.

---

## Movement Patterns (Foundation)

All human movement falls into these patterns. Program should include all:

1. **Squat** - Knee-dominant lower body (quads, glutes)
2. **Hinge** - Hip-dominant lower body (posterior chain)
3. **Push** (Horizontal) - Chest, triceps, front shoulder
4. **Push** (Vertical) - Shoulders, triceps, upper chest
5. **Pull** (Horizontal) - Upper back, rear shoulder, biceps
6. **Pull** (Vertical) - Lats, biceps, upper back
7. **Carry** - Core stability, grip, full-body
8. **Rotation** - Core strength, anti-rotation stability

## Exercise Hierarchy

### Compound > Isolation (Usually)
- **Compound exercises** train multiple joints and muscle groups
- More bang for buck - squat trains quads, glutes, core, back
- Should form foundation of most programs
- Isolation adds targeted volume after compounds

### Bilateral vs. Unilateral
- **Bilateral** (both limbs) - Higher absolute load (back squat, deadlift)
- **Unilateral** (one limb) - Addresses imbalances, sport-specific
- Most programs include both
- Unilateral often better for beginners learning balance

### Free Weights > Machines (Usually)
- **Free weights** require stabilization, more muscle recruitment
- **Machines** useful for isolation, when fatigued, or with injuries
- No dogma - use what serves the goal

## Selection Factors

### 1. Goal Specificity
- **Strength?** Lower reps (1-6), heavier loads, longer rest
- **Hypertrophy?** Moderate reps (6-15), moderate loads, shorter rest
- **Endurance?** Higher reps (15+), lighter loads, minimal rest
- **Sport/skill?** Choose exercises that match movement demands

### 2. Equipment Access
- Adapt to available equipment
- Bodyweight can accomplish most goals
- Bands and dumbbells are versatile substitutes

### 3. Individual Anatomy and Injury History
- Not everyone should do every exercise
- Modify for limb length, joint structure, mobility
- Respect pain signals - find pain-free variations
- Check knowledge entries for user's specific limitations

### 4. Training Experience
- Beginners: Simpler movements, focus on form
- Intermediate: Add complexity and variety
- Advanced: Highly specific to goals

### 5. Recovery Capacity
- Some exercises more fatiguing than others
- Heavy deadlifts require more recovery than leg curls
- Younger, well-recovered trainees can handle more
- Stressed or under-recovered? Choose less taxing exercises

## Common Exercise Options by Pattern

### Squat Pattern
- Back squat, front squat, goblet squat
- Box squat (teaches depth)
- Bulgarian split squat (unilateral)
- Leg press (machine alternative)

### Hinge Pattern
- Deadlift (conventional, sumo, trap bar)
- Romanian deadlift (emphasizes hamstrings)
- Good mornings
- Kettlebell swings (power)
- Hip thrusts (glutes)

### Horizontal Push
- Bench press (barbell, dumbbell)
- Push-ups and variations
- Dips (chest emphasis)
- Landmine press

### Vertical Push
- Overhead press (barbell, dumbbell)
- Handstand push-ups
- Landmine press (angled)

### Horizontal Pull
- Barbell row, dumbbell row
- Cable row, machine row
- TRX/ring rows
- Face pulls (rear delt emphasis)

### Vertical Pull
- Pull-ups, chin-ups
- Lat pulldown
- Assisted pull-ups

### Carry
- Farmer's walk (dumbbells, kettlebells)
- Suitcase carry (unilateral, anti-lateral flexion)
- Overhead carry
- Waiter walk

### Rotation/Anti-Rotation
- Pallof press (anti-rotation)
- Cable chops and lifts
- Russian twists
- Turkish get-ups

## Equipment Substitutions

### No Barbell?
| Barbell Exercise | Alternative |
|------------------|-------------|
| Back squat | Goblet squat, dumbbell squat, Bulgarian split squat |
| Bench press | Dumbbell press, push-ups, dips |
| Deadlift | Dumbbell RDL, single-leg RDL, kettlebell swings |
| Overhead press | Dumbbell press, pike push-ups, handstand push-ups |
| Barbell row | Dumbbell row, TRX row, pull-ups |

### No Equipment?
| Pattern | Bodyweight Options |
|---------|-------------------|
| Squat | Bodyweight squat, pistol squat, jump squat |
| Hinge | Single-leg RDL, Nordic curls, glute bridges |
| Horizontal push | Push-ups (all variations), dips |
| Vertical push | Pike push-ups, handstand push-ups |
| Horizontal pull | TRX/ring rows, inverted rows |
| Vertical pull | Pull-ups, chin-ups, scapular pull-ups |

## Programming Guidelines

### Volume Distribution
- **Compound exercises:** 3-5 sets of 3-12 reps
- **Isolation exercises:** 2-4 sets of 8-20 reps
- **Core/carry:** 2-3 sets of 30-60s or 20-40 yards

### Order Exercises
1. **Most technical or heavy first** - Snatch, clean, heavy squat
2. **Compounds before isolation** - Bench before tricep extensions
3. **Weak points early** - If glutes are weak, hip thrusts early
4. **Fatigue-resistant later** - Carries and core at end

### Variety vs. Consistency
- **Consistency builds skill** - Same movement for 4-8 weeks
- **Variety prevents boredom** - Rotate exercises every block
- **Balance both** - Keep big lifts consistent, vary accessories

## When to Load This File

Load EXERCISE-SELECTION.md when:
- Programming new workouts or phases
- User asks "what exercise should I do for X?"
- Making substitutions due to equipment or injury
- Designing program for new goal or phase
- User wants to understand exercise choices

**Important**: Always filter general principles through user's specific equipment, preferences, and limitations from their knowledge and preference entries.
