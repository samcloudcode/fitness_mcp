# Knee Health Programming

General principles for programming around knee issues and maintaining knee health.

---

## Common Knee Issues

- **Patellar tracking problems** - Kneecap doesn't track properly in the groove
- **Meniscus concerns** - Cartilage damage from twisting or compression
- **IT band syndrome** - Outside knee pain from friction
- **General knee pain** - Non-specific pain during or after training
- **Patellar tendinopathy** - Tendon pain below kneecap (jumper's knee)

## Programming Principles

### Strengthen Supporting Structures
- **Glutes** (especially glute medius) prevent knee valgus collapse
- **VMO** (vastus medialis obliquus) helps patellar tracking
- **Hamstrings** provide knee stability and balance quad strength
- **Hip mobility** allows proper knee tracking

### Control Depth and Range
- Start with partial range if full depth causes pain
- Box squats control depth precisely
- Gradually increase range as tolerance improves
- Pain-free range is the goal, not arbitrary depth standards

### Monitor Stance and Alignment
- Wider stance often reduces knee stress
- Toes-out angle (10-30°) can help knee tracking
- Knees should track over toes, not cave inward
- Film movements to check alignment

### Manage Volume and Intensity
- High volume jumping/plyometrics stresses knees
- Eccentric loading (lowering phase) can rehabilitate tendons
- Heavy bilateral squatting may need to be reduced
- Unilateral work distributes load differently

## Exercise Selection

### Generally Safe Options
- **Box squats** - Controlled depth, reduces uncertainty
- **Romanian deadlifts** - Posterior chain without deep knee flexion
- **Step-ups** - Unilateral strength, controlled range
- **Terminal knee extensions** - VMO activation with band
- **Leg curls** - Hamstring strength without compressive load
- **Sled pushes** - Knee-friendly conditioning
- **Glute bridges/hip thrusts** - Glute strength without knee stress

### Modify or Avoid (Depending on Issue)
- **Deep squats** - If painful, use boxes or reduce depth
- **Leg press** - Fixed plane can stress knees; machine angle matters
- **Leg extensions** - High patellar stress; use sparingly
- **Running on incline** - Increases patellar compression
- **High-volume jumping** - Repetitive impact on tendons
- **Lunges** - Can be problematic if knee goes past toes significantly

### Exercise Substitutions
| If This Hurts | Try This Instead |
|---------------|------------------|
| Back squat | Goblet squat, box squat, trap bar deadlift |
| Leg press | Bulgarian split squat, step-ups |
| Running | Cycling, swimming, rowing, sled pushing |
| Jumping | Strength work, low-impact conditioning |

## Cueing and Technique

### Effective Cues
- **"Spread the floor"** - Activates glute medius, prevents valgus
- **"Knees track over toes"** - Prevents inward collapse
- **"Push through heels"** - Emphasizes posterior chain
- **"Screw feet into ground"** - External rotation, glute activation
- **"Sit back"** - Hip hinge emphasis, less knee translation

### Technique Checkpoints
- Film from front and side to assess alignment
- Check for knee valgus (inward collapse) at bottom of squat
- Ensure even weight distribution between feet
- Monitor pain during and 24-48 hours after training
- Progress slowly - increase range before increasing load

## When to Load This File

Load KNEE-HEALTH.md when:
- User mentions knee pain or has knee-related goals
- Programming lower body work for someone with knee history
- User asks about exercise modifications for knees
- Designing around a knee limitation mentioned in knowledge entries
- User reports new knee discomfort

**Important**: This file provides general principles. Always check user's specific `knowledge` entries for their individual responses and history.
