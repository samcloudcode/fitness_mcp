# Knee Health Programming

Evidence-based principles and daily protocol for bulletproof knees.

---

## Core Philosophy: Train Through Full ROM

**The Myth**: "Never let knees go over toes"
**The Reality**: Knees-over-toes movement is safe and strengthens the knee through full range.

- Elite weightlifters squat ATG with knees forward → healthiest knees
- "The knee that can go farthest and strongest is the most protected" (Poliquin)
- Restricting knee travel shifts stress to hips/back (worse outcomes)
- **Key**: Progressive loading through full range builds tissue tolerance

## Muscle Groups That Protect Knees

### 1. Quadriceps (Front Thigh)
**Why**: Stabilize patella, control knee extension, act as shock absorbers
**Evidence**: Strong quads = fewer knee injuries (patellofemoral pain, general instability)
**Train**: Deep squats, split squats, step-ups, wall sits through full ROM

### 2. Hamstrings & Glutes (Posterior Chain)
**Why**:
- Hamstrings stabilize tibia, protect ACL
- Glute medius prevents knee valgus (inward collapse)
- Share load with quads

**Evidence**: Weak hamstrings = higher ACL injury risk; strong glutes = proper knee tracking
**Train**: Nordic curls, glute bridges, hip thrusts, lateral band walks

### 3. Calves & Tibialis (Lower Leg)
**Why**:
- Soleus (bent-knee) supports knee during flexion activities
- Tibialis anterior controls deceleration, reduces knee stress
- Balanced lower leg = better shock absorption

**Train**: Bent-knee calf raises (soleus), tibialis raises (toe lifts)

### 4. Hip Mobility (External Rotation)
**Why**: Knee is a hinge joint with minimal rotation capacity
**Critical**: Stiff hips in lotus/yoga → knee compensates → meniscus injury
**Strategy**: Earn hip prerequisites first (90/90 stretches, pigeon pose) before deep yoga

## 10-Minute Daily Bulletproofing Protocol

Do 3-5x/week minimum. Can split into 5min sessions if needed.

### 1. Backward Walk/Sled Pull (2-3 min)
**What**: Walk backward 20-30 steps × 2-3 sets OR retro walking
**Why**: Activates quads through full ROM, minimal joint stress, wakes up VMO
**How**: Knees bent over toes, controlled steps. Use light sled or bodyweight on treadmill/ground

### 2. Tibialis Raises (3×15-20)
**What**: Toe lifts against wall, feet 1-2 ft forward
**Why**: Strengthens shin muscle for deceleration, reduces knee stress
**How**: Keep knees straight, lift toes toward shins. Farther from wall = harder

### 3. Deep Squat or Split Squat (2×8-12 each)
**What**: Choose one:
- Heels-elevated goblet squat (ATG depth)
- ATG split squat (hamstring covers calf)

**Why**: Full-range strength in deep flexion → resilient knees
**How**: Slow descent, knees track over toes, heel flat (use wedge if needed). Form > load

### 4. Nordic Curls or Hamstring Bridge (2×5-8)
**What**:
- Nordic: Kneel, lower forward eccentrically, catch with hands
- Alt: Single-leg bridge (heel on bench)

**Why**: Eccentric hamstring strength protects ACL, proven injury prevention
**How**: Control the negative on Nordics. Use band assist if needed. Quality > reps

### 5. Lateral Band Walks (2×10-15 steps)
**What**: Mini-squat position, band around legs, step sideways
**Why**: Strengthens glute med/min → prevents knee valgus
**How**: Toes forward, maintain tension, feel outer hip burn

### 6. Bent-Knee Calf Raises (2×15)
**What**: Calf raises with knees bent 30-40°
**Why**: Targets soleus for knee stability, shock absorption
**How**: Sit or stand with bent knees. Can add weight. High reps to fatigue

### 7. Single-Leg Control (Optional, 1-2 sets)
**What**: Touchdown squat on step OR pistol progression
**Why**: Exposes imbalances, builds unilateral stability
**How**: Stand on 4-6" step, squat on one leg, tap other heel to ground. 5-8 reps/leg

### 8. Hip Mobility Cool-Down (1-2 min)
**What**: Figure-4 stretch, 90/90 hip stretch, gentle half-lotus
**Why**: Maintain/improve hip external rotation for lotus safety
**How**: Rotation from hip NOT knee. Use active mobility (contract/release) for end-range strength

## Programming Principles

### Strengthen Supporting Structures
- **Glutes** (especially glute medius) prevent knee valgus collapse
- **VMO** (vastus medialis obliquus) helps patellar tracking
- **Hamstrings** provide knee stability and balance quad strength
- **Hip mobility** allows proper knee tracking

### Control Depth and Range
- Start with partial range if full depth causes pain
- Box squats control depth precisely
- Gradually increase range as tolerance improves
- Pain-free range is the goal, not arbitrary depth standards

### Monitor Stance and Alignment
- Wider stance often reduces knee stress
- Toes-out angle (10-30°) can help knee tracking
- Knees should track over toes, not cave inward
- Film movements to check alignment

### Manage Volume and Intensity
- High volume jumping/plyometrics stresses knees
- Eccentric loading (lowering phase) can rehabilitate tendons
- Heavy bilateral squatting may need to be reduced
- Unilateral work distributes load differently

## Exercise Selection

### Generally Safe Options
- **Box squats** - Controlled depth, reduces uncertainty
- **Romanian deadlifts** - Posterior chain without deep knee flexion
- **Step-ups** - Unilateral strength, controlled range
- **Terminal knee extensions** - VMO activation with band
- **Leg curls** - Hamstring strength without compressive load
- **Sled pushes** - Knee-friendly conditioning
- **Glute bridges/hip thrusts** - Glute strength without knee stress
- **Backward walks/sled** - Quad strength with minimal stress

### Modify or Avoid (Depending on Issue)
- **Deep squats** - If painful, use boxes or reduce depth
- **Leg press** - Fixed plane can stress knees; machine angle matters
- **Leg extensions** - High patellar stress; use sparingly
- **Running on incline** - Increases patellar compression
- **High-volume jumping** - Repetitive impact on tendons
- **Lotus pose** - Only if sufficient hip mobility (avoid knee rotation)

### Exercise Substitutions
| If This Hurts | Try This Instead |
|---------------|------------------|
| Back squat | Goblet squat, box squat, trap bar deadlift |
| Leg press | Bulgarian split squat, step-ups |
| Running | Cycling, swimming, rowing, sled pushing |
| Jumping | Strength work, low-impact conditioning |

## Coaching Cues

### Effective Cues
- **"Spread the floor"** - Activates glute medius, prevents valgus
- **"Knees track over toes"** - Prevents inward collapse (and allows full ROM)
- **"Push through heels"** - Emphasizes posterior chain
- **"Screw feet into ground"** - External rotation, glute activation
- **"Sit back"** - Hip hinge emphasis, less knee translation

### Technique Checkpoints
- Film from front and side to assess alignment
- Check for knee valgus (inward collapse) at bottom of squat
- Ensure even weight distribution between feet
- Monitor pain during and 24-48 hours after training
- Progress slowly - increase range before increasing load

## Final Coaching Notes

**Consistency > Intensity**: 10 min daily beats 1 hr weekly
**Pain Signals**: Muscle effort good, joint pain bad. Back off if sharp pain
**Progressive Overload**: Add small increments every 1-2 weeks (depth, reps, or load)
**Full-Body Context**: Keep regular squats/deads/running if pain-free—this protocol supplements
**Flexibility**: Include light stretching for quads, hams, calves, ankles on rest days

**Expected Outcomes**: Improved stability, comfort in deep positions, confidence for single-leg work, reduced injury risk
