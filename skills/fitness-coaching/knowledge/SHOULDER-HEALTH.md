# Shoulder Health Programming

General principles for programming around shoulder issues and maintaining shoulder health.

---

## Common Shoulder Issues

- **Impingement** - Rotator cuff compression in overhead positions
- **Rotator cuff strain/tear** - Damage to stabilizing muscles
- **Instability** - Excessive range of motion, dislocation risk
- **AC joint pain** - Top of shoulder pain (acromioclavicular joint)
- **Bicep tendinopathy** - Front shoulder pain along bicep tendon
- **General shoulder pain** - Non-specific pain during pressing or pulling

## Programming Principles

### Balance Pushing and Pulling
- **Maintain 1:1 or 1:2 push:pull ratio** (volume)
- Pulling strengthens posterior shoulder and scapular stabilizers
- External rotation work prevents internal rotation dominance
- Rows, pull-ups, and face pulls balance pressing

### Emphasize Scapular Control
- Strong, stable scapulae are foundation for healthy shoulders
- Retraction (squeeze shoulder blades together)
- Depression (pull shoulder blades down, away from ears)
- Upward rotation (shoulder blades rotate during overhead work)
- Scapular push-ups and wall slides teach control

### Respect Individual Anatomy
- Some people lack overhead mobility due to bone structure
- Not everyone needs to press overhead
- Incline pressing may be safer than strict overhead
- Pain is a signal - modify movements that consistently hurt

### Warm Up Properly
- Band pull-aparts, face pulls before pressing
- External rotation work with light bands
- Shoulder circles and arm swings
- Gradually increase range of motion

## Exercise Selection

### Generally Safe Options
- **Incline press** - Less shoulder stress than flat bench
- **Landmine press** - Scapula-friendly pressing angle
- **Floor press** - Limits range, reduces stretch
- **Neutral-grip pressing** - Reduces internal rotation stress
- **Rows (all variations)** - Strengthen posterior shoulder
- **Face pulls** - External rotation + posterior shoulder
- **Band pull-aparts** - Scapular retraction, rotator cuff
- **TRX/ring exercises** - Natural movement paths

### Modify or Avoid (Depending on Issue)
- **Barbell bench press** - Fixed path can stress shoulders
- **Behind-the-neck pressing** - Extreme shoulder position
- **Dips** - Can impinge shoulder if too deep
- **Upright rows** - Often causes impingement
- **Wide-grip pulling** - May stress AC joint
- **Overhead pressing** - If impingement present, reduce or avoid

### Exercise Substitutions
| If This Hurts | Try This Instead |
|---------------|------------------|
| Barbell bench press | Dumbbell press, landmine press, push-ups |
| Overhead press | Landmine press, incline press |
| Dips | Close-grip push-ups, bench dips (partial range) |
| Pull-ups | Lat pulldown, ring rows, TRX rows |
| Upright rows | Lateral raises, face pulls |

## Cueing and Technique

### Effective Cues
- **"Pack your shoulders"** - Retract and depress scapulae
- **"Proud chest"** - Maintain thoracic extension
- **"Elbows at 45°"** - Avoid 90° flare during pressing
- **"Break the bar"** - External rotation during bench press
- **"Shoulders down and back"** - Scapular stability

### Technique Checkpoints
- Shoulders should stay down (not shrugged toward ears)
- Maintain natural arch in upper back
- Control the eccentric (lowering) phase
- Full range of motion in pain-free zone only
- Monitor pain during and 24-48 hours after training

## Prehab and Rehab Work

### Essential Exercises
- **Face pulls** - 2-3x15-20, high-rep posterior shoulder work
- **Band pull-aparts** - 2-3x20-30, scapular retraction
- **External rotation** - With band or light dumbbell, 2x15-20 each side
- **YTWs** - Shoulder stability complex
- **Wall slides** - Scapular control in overhead position

### Recovery Strategies
- Reduce volume and intensity if pain increases
- Focus on pain-free range of motion
- Increase pulling relative to pressing temporarily
- Add extra rest days if needed
- Consider professional assessment if pain persists
