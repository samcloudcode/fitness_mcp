# Periodization & Training Phases

Framework for structuring training over time to optimize adaptation and avoid plateaus.

---

## What Is Periodization?

Systematic variation of training variables (volume, intensity, frequency, exercise selection) over time to:
- Maximize adaptation
- Prevent plateaus and overtraining
- Peak for specific events or goals
- Manage fatigue accumulation

---

## Training Phases (Block Periodization)

### 1. Hypertrophy Phase (Muscle Building)
**Goal**: Increase muscle mass and work capacity

**Characteristics**:
- **Reps**: 6-15 per set (moderate)
- **Sets**: 3-5 per exercise (high volume)
- **Intensity**: 60-80% 1RM (moderate)
- **Rest**: 60-120 seconds (shorter)
- **Duration**: 4-8 weeks

**Why Use It**:
- Builds muscle that can later be trained for strength
- Creates "foundation" for strength gains
- Good for bodybuilding goals or size-related sports
- Manageable fatigue while building capacity

**Example Exercises**:
- Squats: 4x10 @ 70% 1RM
- Bench: 4x12 @ 65% 1RM
- Rows: 3x15 @ 60% 1RM

### 2. Strength Phase (Maximal Strength)
**Goal**: Increase maximal force production

**Characteristics**:
- **Reps**: 1-6 per set (low)
- **Sets**: 3-6 per exercise (moderate-high volume)
- **Intensity**: 80-95% 1RM (high)
- **Rest**: 3-5 minutes (longer)
- **Duration**: 3-6 weeks

**Why Use It**:
- Increases 1RM and maximal strength
- Neural adaptations (recruitment, rate coding)
- Essential for strength goals
- Foundation for power development

**Example Exercises**:
- Squats: 5x3 @ 85% 1RM
- Bench: 4x5 @ 82% 1RM
- Deadlift: 4x4 @ 85% 1RM

### 3. Power Phase (Speed and Explosiveness)
**Goal**: Increase rate of force development

**Characteristics**:
- **Reps**: 1-5 per set (low, explosive)
- **Sets**: 3-6 per exercise
- **Intensity**: 30-80% 1RM (lighter for speed)
- **Rest**: 3-5 minutes (full recovery)
- **Duration**: 3-4 weeks

**Why Use It**:
- Sport-specific for explosive athletes
- Olympic lifts, jumps, throws
- Converts strength into speed
- Requires technical proficiency

**Example Exercises**:
- Power clean: 5x3 @ 75% 1RM
- Box jumps: 5x5
- Medicine ball throws: 4x6

### 4. Peaking Phase (Competition Prep)
**Goal**: Express maximum performance at specific time

**Characteristics**:
- **Volume**: Low (reduced sets and reps)
- **Intensity**: Very high (90-100% 1RM)
- **Frequency**: Reduced
- **Duration**: 1-3 weeks

**Why Use It**:
- Dissipates fatigue while maintaining fitness
- Tests 1RM or competition lifts
- Used before powerlifting meets, strength tests

**Example**:
- Week 1: 3x3 @ 90%
- Week 2: 2x2 @ 95%
- Week 3: Test 1RM

### 5. Deload Phase (Planned Recovery)
**Goal**: Recover while maintaining fitness

**Characteristics**:
- **Volume**: 40-60% of normal (reduced)
- **Intensity**: 60-80% of normal (reduced)
- **Duration**: 1 week every 4-8 weeks

**Why Use It**:
- Allows recovery from accumulated fatigue
- Prevents overtraining
- Refreshes motivation
- Often leads to new PRs after deload

**Example**:
- If normal is 4x10 @ 185lbs, deload is 3x8 @ 135lbs
- Or reduce frequency from 4 days to 2-3 days

## Progressive Overload Strategies

### 1. Increase Load
Most straightforward - add weight to the bar
- Works well for linear progression (beginners)
- Eventually plateaus (can't add weight forever)

### 2. Increase Volume
Add sets or reps
- Effective for hypertrophy
- Can accumulate fatigue quickly

### 3. Increase Frequency
Train movement pattern more often
- Daily squatting, high-frequency benching
- Requires careful fatigue management

### 4. Increase Range of Motion
Deficit deadlifts, paused squats, deeper stretches
- Often overlooked but effective
- Increases difficulty without adding weight

### 5. Decrease Rest Periods
More work in less time
- Good for conditioning and work capacity
- Less effective for pure strength

### 6. Improve Exercise Quality
Better technique, tempo control, mind-muscle connection
- Underrated strategy
- Makes same weight feel harder

## Practical Periodization Models

### Linear Periodization (Classic)
Hypertrophy → Strength → Power → Peak

**Pros**: Simple, works for beginners
**Cons**: De-trains earlier qualities, less flexible

### Undulating Periodization (DUP)
Vary intensity and volume within the week
- Monday: Heavy (strength)
- Wednesday: Moderate (hypertrophy)
- Friday: Light (power or technique)

**Pros**: Maintains multiple qualities, less boring
**Cons**: More complex planning

### Block Periodization
2-6 week blocks focused on single quality
- Block 1: Hypertrophy (4 weeks)
- Block 2: Strength (4 weeks)
- Block 3: Peak (2 weeks)

**Pros**: Deep adaptation to each quality
**Cons**: Requires longer timeline

## When to Progress, When to Deload

### Signs You Need to Progress
- Current weights feel easy
- Completing all reps with good form
- RPE consistently low (6-7 when expecting 8-9)
- Feeling fresh and recovered

### Signs You Need to Deload
- Multiple sessions feeling harder than they should
- Sleep quality declining
- Resting heart rate elevated
- Loss of motivation
- Persistent soreness
- Form breakdown earlier in sets
- Strength going backward

## Training Age Considerations

### Beginners (0-2 years)
- **Linear progression works** - add weight every session
- **Simple programs** - full body 3x/week
- **Focus on technique** over complex periodization
- **Deload every 8-12 weeks**

### Intermediate (2-5 years)
- **Need periodization** - linear progression stops working
- **Block or undulating models** effective
- **Deload every 4-8 weeks**
- **Track progress more carefully**

### Advanced (5+ years)
- **Complex periodization** required
- **Individualized approaches**
- **Deload every 3-6 weeks**
- **Small gains require precision**

## When to Load This File

Load PERIODIZATION.md when:
- Planning training programs or phases
- User asks about training phases or progression
- Deciding when to change exercises or intensity
- User has plateaued and needs new approach
- Programming for specific event or competition
- User asks "how long should I do this?"

**Important**: Adjust general principles based on user's training age, goals, and recovery capacity from their knowledge and preference entries.
